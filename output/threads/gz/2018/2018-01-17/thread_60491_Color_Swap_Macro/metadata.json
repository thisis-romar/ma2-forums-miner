Basically creating a color swap \"bump\" that can be applied at anytime without programming hard values into a temp.I have found a way to do it, but the values stay active in the programmer.  Which is cool on it own, but I would like it to be more like a flash than a toggle.Here is a video of what the attached macro does.External Contentyoutu.beContent embedded from external sources will not be displayed without your consent.Display all external contentThrough the activation of external content, you agree that personal data may be transferred to third party platforms.
