Currently it looks like:Codesetvar $loop = 7That third cue list is going to be long, so I'm automating the build with a macro, but can't come up with a way to create the cmd value of the cue from within another macro. Ideally, I would also be able to change the value of a given cue's loop with another macro, something like:Codesetvar $thisloop = (\"Where to loop?\")setvar $cue = (\"Cue?\")Assign Sequence 3 Cue $cue /Cmd=\"setvar $loop = \"$thisloop",
