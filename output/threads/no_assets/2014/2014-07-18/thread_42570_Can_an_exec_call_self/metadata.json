I've set off time to 0.7This has the effect of snapping the fixtures to open white and the fading back to the underlying color (nice with LED fixtures).  It all works fine untill I need to move the button; at which point I have to update the cmd to refer to the new location.My question: Is there a way for an exec to refer to itself dynamically?  Kind of like the new $SELECTEDEXEC in 3.0.0.4 but without it having to be the selected exec.  something like $SELFEXECOr maybe a different way to achieve the same end result.Thanks in advance",
