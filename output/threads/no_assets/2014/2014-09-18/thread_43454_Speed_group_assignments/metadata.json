The goal is to leave effects with their associated speed masters for busking, but quickly turn all effects into isolated speeds for programming cues that require specific speeds, i.e. not slave to a speed master. Ultimately I want to write a huge macro to automate the process of turning all effects to be slave to speed masters, or run independently.Any thoughts on how this can be worded in command line?Thanks!PS: yes, I know this is a duplicate post from the forum; my apologies, but I thought this should end up in the Macro section. Sorry for reposting",
