In itself that works fine, but the thing I cannot figure out, is how to also automaticly switch to screen 2. I cannot get past the command section, and I can't seem to find a syntax that mimics a buttonpress on \"screen 2\"The goal of this exercise is to have multiple users login, activate a certain macro to load a certain show, without having any further knowledge of OnPc. On the attached wing there are a few executors to play with, and I would also like them to have screen 2 active, on which I made a layoutview.Thanks",
