At the venue I'm working at we have 2 types of wash lights (MAC 301 and LED PAR cans), both RGB LED with MixColor as preferred colormode.I find that in some cases when I busk shows I would liked to have the color swap, so the color scheme is the same, but the colors changes fixture. And instead of setting up a bunch of pallets for this, or have to select each group and color, I was wondering if it possible to program a macro that can do this with one click? Indepentend of which color presets that are selected for each fixture type.It well may be that it is a stupid newbie question, but hey, I'm a newbieThanks in advance!",
