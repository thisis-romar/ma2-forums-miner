Now downloading the show file seems to interrupt and stop this macro so it never recalls the view, even if I add a delay time to that part of the macro.Is there any way to have a station execute a macro after it joins the session?Problem is the station needs to recall the views because they pertain to an external monitor and another station uses different resolution monitors which in cause the views for that user profile to display incorrectly at first.",
