Or in other terms: Commands are non-blocking? If this is really the case that is BAD BAD BAD!This leads me to the following questions:- Is this 'only' true for macros?- If the operations are not executed sequentially, may I assume they get pooled and there are different worker threads executing them?- and therefore: Is at least the execution order preserved? Is the command execution atomic? Variable-assignment??Or to make things worse:- What happens if there is parallel execution happening? (e.g. executing the same macro multiple times in parallel)- What happens if there is a shared session running?Once again, relying on timing is areallybad style to avoid race conditions. Please, that cannot be true?Any hints, background information and workarounds are appreciated!-- mvo",
