But some Value is wrong , so i try to Remove the Value out of the Preset with Select the Fixture (only 1 fixture is in the patch) than make active the parameter i wanna remove store /Global / remove and hit the preset... but the wrong values are still in the preset.So i remember that there is something new in 3.1.1 that there are also fixturetypes stored in the preset.i go for it and say edit preset and than i see in the programmer \"fixturetype 16.1.1 is included\".SO i try to remove that but nothing works... what is the right way to remove some value of a fixture type from a preset??Any ideas?(What i try is 1. Select Fixturetype 16.1.1 / all values active / store , global , remove ... nothing changes and 2. edit preset / off fixturetype 16.1.1 / update...nothign changes)Thx",
