What I'm trying to do (and have seen done successfully) is to have an image copied to whichever object I have currently selected in my layout, e.g. a color, position, gobo, etc.I have my image chosen that I would like to use, but I can't figure out how to get it to only be copied to one object within a layout, and then when I select another object, have the first return to it's original image.Thoughts?",
