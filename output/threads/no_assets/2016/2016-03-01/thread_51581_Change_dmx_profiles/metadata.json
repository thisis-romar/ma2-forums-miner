I have been fighting this issue with usually modifying the profile to the default gobo stop value and record a few sequences with slow, med and faster spin sequences. However never found a way to make a spin speed to be controlled by a speed master, Ideally I would like it to be controllled by effect and when I shut it down it gradually fades to default position.I have tryed before to limmit the dmx profile to have 0% as stop rotation and 100% as my full speed spin.Now adding to the complexity of the above... I am trying to prep my rig of B-Eyes, where the continueous spin is shared with index of the zoom rotation which gives coledo effect. So in this case I doo need to go past the spinning range to make my wide caledo look.So here is my ideas:1. Create (2) dmx profiles, one for spin and the other for indexing range, assign dmx profile spin to related dmx slots, then make a macro to replace dmx profile spin with indexing,***Someone please let me know how?2. Create one dmx profile, then via root assign new values to dmx profile everytime I want to swith in between profiles.Finnaly after switching to appropriatte (mode) program my cues with a thought in mind that I have to run the macro in every sequence which includes the related attributeLooking for comments, sugestions, your ways to do it",
