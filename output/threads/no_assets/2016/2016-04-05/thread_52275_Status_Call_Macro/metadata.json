My show is timecoded and during sound checks with the band ill turn off timecode to update a cue, once I'm finished I would like the cue list to catch back up. This is not a huge issue for me but I was really curious if it could even be done. Im always amazed at how powerful the macros are on the MA2 and thought I would throw this out there.",
