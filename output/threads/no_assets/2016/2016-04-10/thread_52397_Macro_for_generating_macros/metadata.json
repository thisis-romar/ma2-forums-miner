What im trying to do is write a macro that asks which macro do i want to create and then asks which executor to reference and which cue. So far I have it as:Assign Macro 1.(Which Macro?).1 /cmd= \"Goto Executor 2.103 Cue ($Cue)\"Which doesnt work. I am ok (for now) with having to go back and change the executor number but i want to not have to go back each time and change the cue number or else i might as well just type out each macro anyways. Is there also a way to increase the UserVar integer by one? that way I can just say do this 10 times and then ask me again about wich executor to use.Thanks guysConnor",
