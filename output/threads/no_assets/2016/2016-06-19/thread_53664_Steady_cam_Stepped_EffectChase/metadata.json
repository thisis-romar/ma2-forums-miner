DimMax, DimHalf, DimMinI need a bump/wave to travel along these 20 fixtures step by step. With my key fixture at DimMax, fixture either side DimHalf and the rest remaining at DimMin.This need to travel as the same speed as the actors and steady cam down a corridor....I have two approaches; build a seq or an effectIf I build a 20 step sequence, with fade times, and manually trigger each cue as the steady cam passes... this works, but what if the lighting cameraman needs a width of two fixtures for the max level... I would need to rebuild the sequence again.... boring... and slow if needed on the fly....Is there a way in which I can control a Single Shot effect with the same level of control?Any ideas are appreciated. I've got a week to perfect a solution.Dan.",
