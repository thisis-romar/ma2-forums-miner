Here's what I'm wanting to do:Write a macro that will store a cue and then label that cue with a predefined name (i.e. Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc).I've got macros that will store the cue, go to the cue, and then run the Label command. Then I have to type the name. I'm trying to eliminate typing the name itself, but if I put anything after the \"Label\" command, it tries to find a cue labeled that name.Anyone know how to do this? I'm just wanting several different macros that I can push \"Store Verse\" \"Store Chorus\" \"Store Bridge\" etc etc.Bonus points if I could have a single macro that I can push and then type in a number. 1=Verse 2=Chorus 3=Bridge, etc.-Tyler",
