I've got everything working apart from labelling the cue. it works fine if i put \"Label Cue 20 \"Blackout\"\" but because I've created a new cue in the macro and the macro doesn't know the cue number, I cant put anything where 13 is in the command i just listed.CodeClearSelectionIfOutput EffectStomp Effect 1 ThruChannel 1 Thru At 0Fixture 1 Thru At 0Store Time 1GoClearAllI just need to know what I need to put in the command line that labels the last cue in the selected executor as \"blackout\".",
