In my pan/tilt effects these fixtures will act as the fixture I have cloned and i need to reselect the fixtures in my effect to get the effect to work as it was suppose.I want to press a macro. Then press my group of spots. And i want all effects that has these spots in them get updated.Edit:Store Effect 1.\"spot*\".* could do what i want... Anything better?",
