I would like a way to replace all of the tilt values in these presets with the tilt value of a different preset (FOH Tilt Master). That way I only have to update a few different presets each day.I have tried: Copy Preset {{Tilt Master}} Attribute \"TILT\" at Preset {{x THRU x}} Attribute \"Tilt\"No luck.Also tried: Replace Preset {{ x THRU x}} Attribute \"TILT\" With Preset {{ Tilt Master}} Attribute \"TILT\"Only looking to replace the tilt values. Anybody know the proper syntax?Also if you have any suggestions for doing position presets in a different way I'd love to hear them. My basic idea is that I want a couple presets (FOH left, FOH Right, FOH Tilt) to populate more presets based on those values.",
