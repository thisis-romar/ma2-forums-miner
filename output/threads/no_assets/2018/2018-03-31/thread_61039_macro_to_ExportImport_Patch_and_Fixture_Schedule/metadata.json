How can I make macro to export or import my patch from version 3.0.0.5 to 3.3.4.3?I have an old file that both works on PC and 3d but if I open the old file after upgrading to 3.3.4.3 the the fixtures are unresponsive when I open 3d version of 3.3.4.3. I just don't want to go thru the patching of every single fixture.Best,Marlon",
