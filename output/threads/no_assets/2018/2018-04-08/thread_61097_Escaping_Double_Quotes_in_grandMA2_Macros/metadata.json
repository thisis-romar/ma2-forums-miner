  "post_text": "April 8, 2018 at 2:07\u202fPM#1Hello,Is anyone aware of a way of escaping double quotes in a grandMA2 macro?I am trying to get the macro to enter some double quotes in the info line of a cue but since the double quotes are needed by the /info=\" \" command, I cannot put double quotes inside there.  I know I could do single quotes but I am trying to keep the cue sheet coherent and double quotes are simply easier to read.Thanks in advance,Bernard LetendreHead of LightingCirque du Soleil - AMALUNA Tour",
