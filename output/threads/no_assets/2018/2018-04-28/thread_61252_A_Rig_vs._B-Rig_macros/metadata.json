What I have done is create 2 Macros. They take certain Groups and assign them a different Position Preset. Then the same with the Bally-Hoo Effect.I created the macros & they seem to work fine. Wanted to post them here and see if anyone had a suggestion on how they could be improved and/or simplified.B-Rig Macro- Group 10 Thru 15 At Preset 2.6- Store /m @ Sequence 1 Cue 0.5 + 13- Group 10 Thru 15 At Effect 2- Store /m @ Sequence 1 Cue 11 + Cue 14A-Rig Macro- Group 10 Thru 15 At Preset 2.5- Store /m @ Sequence 1 Cue 0.5 + 13- Group 10 Thru 15 At Effect 4- Store /m @ Sequence 1 Cue 11 + Cue 14Thanks in advance.Ken",
