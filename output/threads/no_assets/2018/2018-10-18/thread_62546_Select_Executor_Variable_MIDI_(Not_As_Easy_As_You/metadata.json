I have a very special use case for my console so if your like why would you ever need this, just trust me hahah.Pretty much i want a variable that takes the midi imput and selects the appropriate executor based on this. I know i could make 120 odd commands and do it that way but a variable would me more economical.An idea i had, since i know the velocity of the midi note can be represented as a executor fader, is to have the velocity move up and down the fader attached to a macro which takes that and places that as a variable, then send another note to send the select executor [variable] commandfor examplei am using CH 1 NOTE 1 Velocity 100 for the command 'Select Executor [ Variable]'then another note CH1 NOTE 2 and the velocity sets the fader and is assigned a macro to set the variableif anyone has any ideas please let me knowAlso if you know of a macro that will auto cross fade between executors when i turn them off that would be greatThanks,Bensley",
