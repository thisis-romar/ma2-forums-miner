I kinda figured some parts out but i cant figure out how can tell the CMD at which value it should store it.Lets say i want to progam a preset called Gobo 1, in this preset there is a G1 Gobo (so its shouldnt take G1<> aswell, only G1) and from the G1 there is a gobo called \"Gobo 1.1\". How do i store \"Gobo 1.1\" in a preset with a macro? And how can i make this that it will only select the things i want, ofc change the name but if say G1 to the CMD it includes G1<> aswell.Hope someone can help me out",
