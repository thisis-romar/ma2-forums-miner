Is this possible?For example, I'm trying to change specialmaster 3.1 to BPM 120. In the macro I would use:setuservar $songbpm = 120Assign cue 1 /cmd = \"specialmaster 3.1 at $songbpm\"However, since it's in quotations, what is added to the CMD is '$songbpm' instead of 120.Is there any way to make a uservar work in quotations? Or is there another way that I'm not thinking of?",
