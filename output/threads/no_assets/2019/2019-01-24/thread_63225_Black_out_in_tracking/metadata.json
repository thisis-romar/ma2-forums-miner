On the 2nd line of my macro I enter the cue before my black out and on line 9 I add 0.001 to my variable cue destination of my black out. Unfortunately the console adds me 3 zeros and it makes me a mistake ... (See the two photos attached)Someone would have an idea to addvar without the console does not add these 3 zeros?Thank you !Imagesimg1.jpg516.06 kB2,048 \u00d7 1,536img2.jpg465.7 kB2,048 \u00d7 1,536",
