I can make the macro work just fine with a simple reference to the effect in question:Example:assign effect 1.67 /wings= 0Yet I'm attempting to make a series of effects with the same naming convention that can be affected by the same macro.Example:Assign effect 1.*\"stage\"*.1 /wings= 0The idea is to create a series of effects such as stage(wash) stage(wash2) stage(left) etc.... but have one series of macros affect those groups.When I do this I keep getting:error 14 \" Object does not exist\"Am I missing something?",
