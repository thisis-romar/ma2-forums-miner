Recently I started using a macro to assign DMX Profiles to Channels:Assign Profile (\"X\") At Channel X Attribute \"DIM\"Now I would like to use a macro to remove the DMX Profile from the channel, but I don't know how...Delete Profile (\"X\") At Channel X Attribute \"DIM\" seems to delete the profile completly instead of removing it from the channel.Also, at the end of a show/tour, I've used several DMX Profiles, and would like to use a macro like: Delete Profile 1 Thru At Channel 1 Thru Attribute \"DIM\".It feels like its a very simple/basic syntax I'm missing, I just can't find it. Thanks in advance",
