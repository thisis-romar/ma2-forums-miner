Setvar $AgendaDate= (What date would you like?)2. Setvar $AgendaTimeOn= (What time to start?)3. Setvar $AgendaTimeOff= (What time to end?)4. Assign sequ \"Backline work\" at $AgendaDate + $AgendaTimeOn Duration= 1sI'm just guessing really, but hopefully this gets the idea accross. I need the operator to answer questions as to what time and date to turn the sequence on and off.",
