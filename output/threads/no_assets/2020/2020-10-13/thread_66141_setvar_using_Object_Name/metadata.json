So far as I understand you cannot have quotation marks within quotations when setting variables, i.e :setvar $myvar = \"effect 1.\"$whatevereffects\".1\"This syntax doesn't return an error, but the syntax will cut off before my named pool object. I've tried to $\"whatevereffects\" in the syntax but it returns as the same result. Anyone knows the proper syntax for this or if there is a workaround? Any help is much appreciated!",
