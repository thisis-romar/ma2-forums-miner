For example, there're some spot fixtures in my main showfile,that have only 1 gobo wheel. So when I'm changing fixture type or clone this fixtures to another fixture type, and see that some of desured gobos are in gobo wheel 2 and 3, so I cant't add it to my sequences just updating the presets. Do anyone have any solutions for such situations?",
