I select all fixtures and I do please twice, then I store it in a Preset All. When I recall my Preset, the fixtures are not in the expected state (the effect ID is empty in the Effect Layer of the Fixture View).I try to store it again in a other sequence it's ok.I try to store it in a Preset All without the Preset Filter and I allow Embedded.So it is not possible to store Effect ID in a Preset All ?Thanks again for you help !Best regards.",
