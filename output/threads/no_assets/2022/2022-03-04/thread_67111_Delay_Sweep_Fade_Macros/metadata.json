So my cues are 99.1 cue 1 so on and so forth.I want to create macros to delay and sweep color when I click on the color picker.For example, I want a macro to delay 0.5s for each type of fixtures but on just one button. Same thing with sweep and fade but I think the mechanic would be the same as the first one.If you have ideas, that would help me, Thank you.",
