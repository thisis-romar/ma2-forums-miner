For example, whether you are in Gobo or Beam, be able to choose through whatever is on the first encoder. Whether it be Gobo1 to Gobo2, or Shutter to Beam to Effect. Is this possible or is the only way to pull these up by specific name, and not just \"next on that encoder\"?Same question about Normal,Fine,Ultra. Is there syntax to switch through these specific to the encoder and not Attribute name?Or does it have to be something like \"assign attribute pan /encoderresolution=fine\"Thank you",
