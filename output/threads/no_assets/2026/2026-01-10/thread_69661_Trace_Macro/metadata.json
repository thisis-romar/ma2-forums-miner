It basically is an update original content with tracking enabled.So if I'm in Q6 and I change the color to red and update the cue with original content and tracking enabled, it changes the color in Q4 already and tracks it through Q8 in this example (as Q9 is a Breakcue), so far so good, that works also with my trace macro.But when I'm in Q10, I don't want to update Q4 but Q9, the break cue. Q4 is probably in another scene, hence the break, so I don't wanna mess with that. That's also the logic behind trace in EOS and it works also that way in MA2, when I update via update window with original content and tracking enabled. But my Macro is updating Q4. I think it has to do with the \"UPDATE Cue 0.1 thru\" part. But without it, it's not working at all. When I want to have /or (for original content) in the syntax, I need at least \"update cue thru\" in the syntax as well. Only \"Update Cue /or\"  doesn't work....Does anyone know how to achieve this?",
