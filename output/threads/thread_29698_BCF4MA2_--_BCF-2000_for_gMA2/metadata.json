Run everything (ma2, ma23d, bcf4ma2, MidiYoke setup) with administrator priv's and in XP SP3 compat. mode (right click shortcuts, click properties, it's in there somewhere...)2. make sure bcf manager or bc-edit is completely closed before running bcf4ma2.3. turn your bcf2000 off and on again (sounds stupid, but I had to do this after using bc manager).4. loopBe should work, as only one virtual midi cable is required, but i've never tested.  to install MidiYoke on win7 I had to run the MSI install with compatibility troubleshooter.5. i didn't ever install drivers for the bcf-2000 from behringer, just plug and play windows drivers are all thats needed.6. if you use a MAonPC command wing, don't use the midi ports on the wing, andalways turn the wing on last, after first starting MA2onPC and bcf4ma2.7. two behringers can be used in tandem, by connecting with MIDI cables as follows:> The BCF connected thru usb is mode U-4> The BCF connected thru Midi is mode S-4>> Connections made by midi cable has to be:> USB connected (U-4) midi out A --> Midi in A Midi> Connected (S-4)> Midi Connected (S-4) Midi out A --> Midi In A USB> Connected (U-4)>> Same SysEx file for both bcf's>Check the BCF programming manual for how to get mode S-4 and U-4 (hint, its something like hold down 4th button from the left below the encoder, turn power on, turn encoder 1, press store)I'm pretty sure the xp compatibility solves the crash problem for most people, and it makes no performance difference, at least that I can detect.Also, if you don't use MidiYoke, it will ask you for MSC device every time, but this is not so bad I guess.Good luck!CheersFilesBCF4MA2-1.0.zip1.07 MB – 777 Downloads",
