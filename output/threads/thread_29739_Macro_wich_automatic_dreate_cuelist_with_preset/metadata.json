Then it would probably be possible to write a macro that sets the colo of the selection to the first prest, stores it as a cue sets the next color and so on.What I am wondering abouth is tha use of such a macro. Can you explain me how you want to use it? Maybe then I can help you to better."

      "post_text": "March 10, 2012 at 6:03 PM#6Hi Florian,Correct me if I`m wrong, but I understand that you want a macro that is able to:- set the current selection to color preset 1- store this as cue 1 in the selected executer- repeat this process for all the color presetsTo do this you need some kind of loop with a counter. I created a counter macro for this purpose that is able to increase a number (up to 512) by 1. The main macro needs to know the number of the counter and its own macronumber. Therfore the main macro starts with two variable declarations that you have to edit if you don´t load the macros at position 1 and 2.As far as I know there is no way that a macro can know how many color presets you have unless you enter this date. To make it a little more flexible you also have the option to enter a start preset, so that you can use the macro with any group of succeding presets.I didn´t experiment to much with it, but it seems to workGood luck,AartFilesBuildSeq.xml48.37 kB – 94 Downloads"

I created this in a hurry (still working on my own little project) and the counter wasn´t build initially with the idea to use it´s results in a comparation.To get the comparation right I´ll also need to add leading zeros to $preEnd, so I adapted the count macro to create a prefix macro as well that does just that.Furthermore I forgot to use the $preStart variable as the stating point (the macro started always with preset 4.1). Now it is fixed.Finaly I introduced $loolLine (think I got this from one of your macros) to be able to adapt the macro mor flexible and relyable.Here´s the result,AartFilesBuildSeq2.xml96.23 kB – 86 Downloads"
