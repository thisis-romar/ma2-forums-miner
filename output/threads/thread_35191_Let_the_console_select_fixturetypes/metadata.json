      "post_text": "March 31, 2013 at 4:20 PM#5I used the method explained bij Glad, it works also if you use the just the name, for example: if you use CP Sharpy's, you can use the keywords; Fixture Sharpy*, the console will select all the patched Sharpy's, whenever you are using te vector lamp on/of or standard lamp on/off fixture filesThis works also for VL2500 when using the command: Fixture VL2500*, but then it will also select the VL2500 WashesSo what i do now is, i make the correct patch, use a few macro's to create gobo, shutter, color and effectwheel presets and after that i change the names of the fixtures when nessesary, with this method i have my presets ready in a mather of seconds and start being creativeSo it is not exactly what i wanted to do, but for now it works pretty wellThanks for your input!!"
