Not your specific request particularly but there is a definite need for show specific global variables.I've been led to believe that development in the macro area is on the cards......You probably know this butCodeAssign Timecode \"My Timecode\" /offset=xxwhere xx is the number of framesI can picture a really convoluted macro using this if you have a sepearte macro for entering the existing number of offset frames - SetUserVar $Currentframes=( \"Enter current offset in number of frames\" )and then two separate macros for increasing and decreasing the offset ieCode[$Currentframes==\"1\"] SetUserVar $Currentframes=\"2\"[$Currentframes==\"0\"] SetUserVar $Currentframes=\"1\"etc"

I currently need an offset of my entire Timecoded show by 0.25 second.Does anyone already have a solution to this??"
