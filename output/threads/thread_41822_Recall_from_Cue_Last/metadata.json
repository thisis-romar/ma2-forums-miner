Basically would let me select a fixture then set all its attributes including intensity to what it was in the previous cue.I honestly would not know where to begin. Any thoughts would be appreciated.Cheers,D",

Sometimes during the fadeout attributes snap change live in the next cue. I simply need to copy everything from the previous cue and update with intensity at 0.Thanks again.D"
