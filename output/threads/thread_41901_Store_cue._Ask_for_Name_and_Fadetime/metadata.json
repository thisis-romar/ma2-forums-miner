I'm not that good at creating macros that ask questions, so I'm just going to ask you guysI want to create a macro that stores a cue in my selected cuelist, and asks for what name the cue should have and what fadetime it should have. I think this would be possible in some way after reading the manual a bit, right?Since I'm using a PC only setup this would be a hudge timesaver!",
