I want to know if there is a way to suck out the EffectBPM encoder value and assign it to a uservar rather than having the user input a value.EgLine 1: Effect 1 EffectBPMLine 2: On EffectBPM (activates the value in the encoder and programmer)Line 3: Setvar $fx1 = Effect 1 EffectBPMBut I can't as much as I play and tweak find a way to import an encoder value into a macro. I want to do it so that even if the speed is adjusted by any means it takes a \"snapshot\" of the effectBPM so I can manipulate the playback!Any thoughts would be great!CheersGoz",
