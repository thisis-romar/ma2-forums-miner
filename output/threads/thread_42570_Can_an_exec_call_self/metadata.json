I've set off time to 0.7This has the effect of snapping the fixtures to open white and the fading back to the underlying color (nice with LED fixtures).  It all works fine untill I need to move the button; at which point I have to update the cmd to refer to the new location.My question: Is there a way for an exec to refer to itself dynamically?  Kind of like the new $SELECTEDEXEC in 3.0.0.4 but without it having to be the selected exec.  something like $SELFEXECOr maybe a different way to achieve the same end result.Thanks in advance",

I want to be able to call a series of \"hits\" (snap on the fade out) via the cmd line of the primary seq.  If I move the Select then I lose master playback control of the primary seq.I was really looking to see if there was a variable that I could call that would feedback some identifier of the executor that called it.  I guess I'll submit this as a feature request."

Give the executor an off time of 0.7 or whatever you want it to be.Then change the mode for that cue to be \"Release\".As soon as the cue has finished running it will then automatically release itself.Does that do what you're after?Cheers!Tom"
