Then when I release the flash button have a macro trigger that restores the Align back to OFF.Im stuck on the restoring to OFF Align.  I cant seem to get the Syntax \"Off Flash Exectuer 1.107\" to trigger anything.  Ive tried multiple \"if\" commands with no success. Like \"If Off Flash Exec 1.107 Go exec 1.106\" Where 1.106 is the Align Off Seq Executer.Maybe I am over thinking it.  Any help would be appreciated.ThanksJim RoodLighting Designerhttp://www.jimrood.com",

Only need the (release) Remote trigger.I have exec button 1.101 as temp with cue that has dummy 1 @ 100 and Dummy 2 @ 0 with Align <> macro in cmd.  When i release the temp button it resets the dummy channel and triggers another seq on page 999 that has the macro in in for OFF align.Works great!!  Thanks again.Jim RoodLighting Designer/ Programmerhttp://www.jimrood.comjprood@gmail.com"
