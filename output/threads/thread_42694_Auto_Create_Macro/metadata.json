But I am am having trouble creating an AutoCreate Macro.I can't seem to find AutoCreate in the cd/ listI want to make a make a macro that quickly creates the new MA Colors in the Additional Presets/Swatchbook tab of AutoCreate.  I can't seem to find the path to it.  Any hints?I would also like to make a macro for the AutoCreate Hue/Saturation.  Basically asking me \"what group\", \"how many hues\", \"how many saturation\" \"add or merge MixColor\"Can someone point me in the right direction?Thank you.",
