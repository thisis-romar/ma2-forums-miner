At (fix#?) If Sequence (seq#)What if I only want to clone the color of a fixture in a particular sequence and nothing else?I've different variations of...Clone Fixture (fix#?) At Fixture (fix#?) If Preset (preset#?) If Sequence (seq#)...but haven't had any luck.I've also tried variations of my Clone macro to work just on a selected sequence....The original is...SetVar $cloneitems=(0=sequence 1=dim 2=pos 3=gobo 4=color 5=beam 6=focus)[$cloneitems==0] Clone Fixture (fix#?) At Fixture (fix#?) If Sequence 1 Thru[$cloneitems==1] Clone Fixture (fix#?) At Fixture (fix#?) If Preset 1.1 Thru[$cloneitems==2] Clone Fixture (fix#?) At Fixture (fix#?)

If Preset 6.1 ThruIt does great for true cloning for a whole show, but I want it to work for particular sequences only.Any help?There are two things I'm trying to accomplish.1) I have a fixture active in my programmer and I want to copy all active features to selectable fixtures.2) I have a fixture with a look stored in a sequence, but I only want to copy the color and/or gobo information to the other fixtures in that sequence.I've been scrambling my brain trying to figure it out.",
