Now i want to label the sequence with a specific name because i don't want to have several \"col2exec\"-Sequences and don't know which color is stored into them.Of course i could use the preset-names instead of the preset-numbers and put them together with \"AddUserVar\"but it would be great if there is a possibility to do it with numbers.In another macro i store several effects in sequences each for each. So i can go like this:Search for effects i like -> Copy them to 1001 an higher -> Run the macro to get these effects stored in sequences and assign them to executor.I would be glad if someone got an idea for this.thanks a lot,ressi",
