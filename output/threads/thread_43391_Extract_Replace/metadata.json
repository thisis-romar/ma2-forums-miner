I'm working on a auto palletizing macro, Basically want to extract the hard values out of a preset, then use those values to replace the hard values in a sequence with the preset. I can extract the preset values to the programmer, but I can't seem to figure out how to use the values in the programmer as my source for the replace. Anyone have any suggestions??Thanks,Ryan",
