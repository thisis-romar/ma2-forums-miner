Let's say I want to bring channel 1 thru 6 down 6% if their values are above 50 for the entire cuelist. For an idividual, active cue, I would make a macro which goes:IfOutput channel 1 thru 6 at 50 thruAt -6Update /cIf I would make it for a cuelist, I could add a >>> and Go Macro, to make it recursive. But how will I make the makro stop running at the end of the cuelist?",
