I had a command line feedback window created but when I press a preset nothing seems to show up. I figured out what was wrong though. It was because the command line feedback window was open on console 2 , and I was issuing the command with console 1 so nothing showed up. Got it working now. In the window is says \"SelFix Preset 4.1\" but you said \"At Preset 4.1\". Both work, is there any difference between the two? once again thanks so much you probably saved me a few hours of programming."
