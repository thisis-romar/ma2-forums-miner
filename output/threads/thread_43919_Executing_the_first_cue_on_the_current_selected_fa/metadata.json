I am having trouble getting the first cue to fire though. I am trying to avoid using something like \"go executor 10.1\"  because the songs may not be in the same order every day so if I move pages and forget to update the macros I would fire the wrong cue. It would also mean I needed a separate macro for each page. Could someone help me out?",
