      "post_text": "November 11, 2014 at 10:04 AM#5Thanks Andreas.So, the following macro is helpfull to find Fixtures by PresetType from the command IfOutput. Actually it's a workaround to the following command : IfOutput PrestType x, which doesn't work for now.This macro may certainly be improved, but it works. You just have to type the PresetType number (e.g. 4 for Color, 8 for shapers) at the beginning of the macro.Be aware that your programmer values will be lost while running this macro.RegardsFilesIfoutput by PresetType.xml990 Byte – 48 Downloads"
