Channels 51 through 55 and 61 through 65 are at 75%. What I want is to be able to type \"1 ThruOn 100 @ 50\" and have only 51 through 55 and 61 through 65 go to 50% without selecting other channels (amusing they are at 0).Maybe this needs to be an MA+ Thru button command not a macro?Thanks,Brennan"
