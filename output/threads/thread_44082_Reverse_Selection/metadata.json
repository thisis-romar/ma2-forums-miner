      "post_text": "September 4, 2015 at 3:15 PM#5After stating the problem to technical support, the answer fell:the Macros makes us headache.Most of the inquiries comes from the TV Game Shows.A lot of input triggers comes parallel into a console and the console works in a session of course.The multiple Midi inputs cause random Playbacks and they ask us for a solution.We make all the changes and they are happy now because we now have a selective processing of Macros.Also parallel Macros can now operate reliable in the background in a Session.They are all happy now (we hope).On the other hand we loose some nice functions with this changed structure.It's not possible anymore to loop inside Macro lines.You only can loop from the end to the start inside a Macro.Means the nice Macro from Andreas Glad will not work anymore.Maybe this 'Reverse Select' Macro can be done now in LUA.Try to contact the LUA Forum on the Share net for this Please.A really good progress"

What a pityInstead, I will turn to the plug LuaThank you"
