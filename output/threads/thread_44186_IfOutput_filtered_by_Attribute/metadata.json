As the previous one, it's a workaround to the following command : IfOutput Attribute x, which doesn't work for now.You just have to type the Attribute number or name (e.g. 22 for Color1, 1b for rotation of first shaper) at the beginning of the macro.Be aware that your programmer values will be lost while running this macro.RegardsFilesIfoutput by Attribute.xml1.01 kB – 107 Downloads",
