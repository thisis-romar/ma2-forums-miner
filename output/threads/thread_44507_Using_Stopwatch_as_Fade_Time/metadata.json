  "post_text": "December 4, 2014 at 11:03 PM#1Been working at a venue on a show for a few weeks and talking to one of the in-house Lighting Designer/Programmers and he was saying the newer versions of software that you can use the stopwatch in the console to time how long a fade takes, and then use that timer and assign the value as the fade time for the cue.We had a look into it, and found that whilst you can do that, you would have to manually start timer, press go, stop timer, and then assign the value back to the cue.  Had a look into the pre-defined macros aswell, and there isn't anything in there either that does this.So, having a bit of time around shows we decided to each have a crack at making a macro to do it, and came up with the following.  It works for the selected sequence but I am sure you could adapt it to ask for which sequence you wanted to run it on):In the Edit Macro Window:Line 1: Store Timer 555 \"Fade Timer\"  - FOLLOWLine 2: Go Timer 555                       - FOLLOWLine 3: Go                                     - GOLine 4: Toggle Timer 555                  - FOLLOWLine 5: Assign Fade $Timer555 Cue     - FOLLOWLine 6: Off Timer 555Timer number can be anything but wanted to keep it away from anything else you might be using. You can use the locked system stopwatch aswell by using Timer number as 1.On the first press of the Macro button (I have it assigned to a User Button under screen 1) it creates the timer (if it's already there then it just seems to skip this and doesn't throw an error), starts the timer and presses \"Go\" to move into the next cue.The second press of the Macro button will then Pause the timer (toggle from running to paused), and then write that fade time into the cue you've just transitioned into.  It then finally turns the timer off (resets it back to '0') for the next time you want to use it.Might be useful for people who need to get fades a precise time with music, or a person walking across stage where a moving light tracks them (assuming they walk at the same speed every day - which they usually don't!)Thanks to Jeff @ NCFR for looking at it with me and planting the idea that it could be done!  I've uploaded the xml file that can be imported to the console aswell.Hope this helps someone else!MartyFilesCue Fade Timer.xml852 Byte – 181 Downloads",

I had wondered if there was a way for the console to generate a dialogue box where you then input the cue number you want, and then it saves the $timerX value to the cue you specifiy, but didn't manage to get that far... maybe over the next couple of weeks when I'm back in front of a console I can have a play about with it again..."

I have tried \"time\" and \"trigtime\" instead of fade in line 5 but it does not work. And I also guess that instead of the time entered in the cue that I started in, the value should be entered in the cue that I end in.Does anybody know the magic word?"

I'm going to take a look at my user settings on this forum to see if I've missed something!Thedge- I created this more for a use during a live situation.  Say you have a performer who is DSC and then at a particular moment they move to DSR, and you want the lighting to track the movement (could be used for anything though like a set piece flying in that you want to track, or a sweep that you want timed precisely to music etc).With this macro, it the first press of the button will trigger the 'go' on the selected cuelist, and set the timer running.  If you press the button again (say when the performer has reached their next mark, the set piece is in position, or the music has ended) then it will read the exact time taken from the timer and store that as your fade time.Obviously this assumes that your performer moves at roughly the same speed every day, or your flying piece is the same speed, but I've found it useful a few times during rehearsals to get a more exact fade time than having to try and guess how many 1/10ths of a second I need to add to get it right.I am not sure how you would do this with an exec time?In theory it could be used for delay times, or any other parameter that you can assign a time to.  Thanks for replying on how to create a dialogue box.Marty"
