  "post_text": "March 28, 2015 at 12:29 PM#1Hi all,This week I created 3 nice macro's to change the store option,(pf filter,embedded and store mode)The first 2 macro's works fine for me.But the third(mode selective,global,universal) are not working fine.my syntax is:  Assign Root 39.$USERPROFILE.15.3 /MODE=SELECTIVEWhen I look in the TUI (CD 39.userprofile.15) the syntax works.But when i return to the store option menu the mode is still the same.Can someone tell my why the TUI and the store option menu are not linked?Many thanks,Cedric",
