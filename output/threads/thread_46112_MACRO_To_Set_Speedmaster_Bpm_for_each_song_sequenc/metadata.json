  "post_text": "April 6, 2015 at 5:52 PM#1Ok, I have been trying for some time to write a macro that will write a line in the CMD column of my \"Set\" cue at the beginning of each song to set BPM to a generic speed master, but I keep running into limitations that won't allow me to.  Here is what I have come up with and some of the limitations I am running into.Workflow goal....   To use the learn key on a Speed master called \"Tempo\" to capture a songs tempo and then capture that BPM in a uservar that is then written into the cmd line of the first cue of a song sequence...First problem is, that there is no way to get the MA2 to call the BPM of a Speed Master and assign that value to a uservar, so I have realized I need to manually enter the BPM after reading it off of the Speed master with a macro such as this...Generic speed master is labeled \"tempo\"setuservar $tempo=(Enter Song Tempo)assign executor 21 cue \"set\"/cmd=\"specialmaster 3.tempo at $tempo\"The first issue I am running into with the second line of the macro is that the uservar $tempo is a variable and will change it's value after each song I write...   since each song will have it's own discreet BPM..   So I want the second line to place a numeric value into the cmd column, not call a uservar, but I need to use a uservar to temporarily store that value so I can use the same macro to automate the building of each first cue in a song sequence...  Such as this..assign executor 21 cue \"set\"/cmd=\"specialmaster 3.tempo at 61.5\"The problem I am running into, is that I have not figured out how to get the numerical value of \"61.5\" into the cmd column of the cue by using a temporary uservar to actually write \"61.5\" at the end of the syntax \"specialmaster 3.tempo at\".The macro....    assign executor 21 cue \"set\"/cmd=\"specialmaster 3.tempo at\"Will write... specialmaster 3.tempo at...  into the cmd line, but now I need to get.... 61.5 ....in there after the assign macro..The macro...  assign executor 21 cue \"set\"/cmd=$tempoWill write...  61.5  ..  in the cmd column...So I can get the assign macro in there, and also get the value for $tempo in there, but I haven't been able to figure out how to get both in the same command line...I don't want to use a separate \"tempo\" uservar for each song and I also don't want to have a macro for each song..  I am specifically looking for a generic tool/macro that will simply speed up the process of having to manually write the cmd line ofassign executor 21 cue \"set\"/cmd=\"specialmaster 3.tempo at 60\"Ohh, and I have also tried the following macroassign executor 21 cue \"set\"/cmd=\"specialmaster 3.tempo at (Enter Song BPM)\"Any help would be appreciated",
