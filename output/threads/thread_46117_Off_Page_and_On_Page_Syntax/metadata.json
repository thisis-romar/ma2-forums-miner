By globally shutting off all executors on page one which is my \"Fixes/Template\" page and contains my speedmaster for general tempo it also shuts off all sequences with that speedmaster assigned to it..   Easy fix was to be more selective and not include the speedmaster on page one in the page off macro...Thanks again...Your a tremendous help..JB"
