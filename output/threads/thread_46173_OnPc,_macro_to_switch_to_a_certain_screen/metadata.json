In itself that works fine, but the thing I cannot figure out, is how to also automaticly switch to screen 2. I cannot get past the command section, and I can't seem to find a syntax that mimics a buttonpress on \"screen 2\"The goal of this exercise is to have multiple users login, activate a certain macro to load a certain show, without having any further knowledge of OnPc. On the attached wing there are a few executors to play with, and I would also like them to have screen 2 active, on which I made a layoutview.Thanks",

I have a constant annoying problem that when ever I start up one setup one of my screens opens up non maximized with the screen 1, 2, etc buttons overlapping onto the second display.So you need to mess around getting the mouse and making it right."
