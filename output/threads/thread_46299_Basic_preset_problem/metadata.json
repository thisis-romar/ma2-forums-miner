Setup/ Autocreate provides access to create a preset reference and to create presets from a preset reference. Preset reference is part of the fixture type and will be exported and imported inside the fixture type file.Preset references can be created via commandline. At first a fixture of a fixture type must be selected. With the command \"Store Fixturetype x.5\" all presets of the currently selected fixtures are added to this fixture type. If a reference already exists, a pop-up occurs. The command can be restricted to single presettypes :\"Store Fixturetype x.5 if Presettype \"colour\". With \"Autocreate Preset Fixturetype x\" all preset of that type will be generated and to eventually existing merged (same name). With the extension \"/add\" always new presets are added. This can be limited with \"if\" for each presettype. Presets are identified by their name of each presettype and applicable overwritten. Example: \"Store Fixturetype x.5 /remove if Presettype \"colour\".Autocreate Presets creates preset label by merging channelset and attribute label.some ideas?"
