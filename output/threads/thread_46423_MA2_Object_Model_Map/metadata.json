      "post_text": "May 11, 2015 at 6:52 PM#4Ok, here is a recent example that was already solved by another user...Quote from mike.brytedesignHi,I'm trying to write a macro to change the externalstart universe. This macro wants to have a fixedpredetermined value for the universe it is settingit to.Any help would be greatly appreciated.This is basically to allow for console switchingon the artnet input. Each console is on a separate subnet....Worked it out.Assign Root 4.1.2 /externstart=16ThanksDisplay MoreLooking at the map, you can trace this same path. Starting from Root, Directory 4 is DMX Protocols, then 1, for Artnet. The last number is the item number (id) of the ArtnetData collection (Shown in [color=#FF9900]Orange[/color]), in this case it is second item listed. /externstart is the property (shown in [color=#00FF00]Green[/color] on the Map)ASSIGN is the keyword, and depending on where you are in the directory, you will need part of the path.In Mike's solution, the command includes the entire path from Root. I recommend the same, unless you are doing a very involved marco.If you want to include this as part of a larger setup marco and have a need to change directories. CD 4, CD 1, Assign 2 /externstart=16 works as well. I would use this route if I wanted to set several properties of several collections, such as DMX ouput and ip address of consoles and NPUs.The text in the map is searchable so if you know what [color=#00FF00]property[/color] you are looking to change, you can find it and work out the path back to root.Since I brought up DMX, suppose we need a macro to turn on and off a DMX port of a console.The directory names are pretty straight forward, and often are the only clue you need. There is a directory called \"Consoles\" (FYI, you will also notice that IP is a [color=#00FF00]property[/color] here) with a [color=#FF9900]Collection[/color] called console. Each console in the system is represented as a number, and the DMXPorts is the only [color=#FF00FF]object[/color] found in each item (console) in the [color=#FF9900]collection[/color]So if we want to turn off the DMX of port A on console #2, the full string isAssign Root 5.1.2.1 /XLRA=OffOn the map, I've start to put in Valid Values in [color=#00FFFF]Cyan.Integer, IN, Out, Off, and On[/color]are all valid values for [color=#FF00FF] DMXPorts. [/color]I hope this helps. I think more work needs to be done showing examples within the map, but I think you can see how useful this would be if it was complete.Thanks again,- Kurt"

Currently, most of the info in the drawing is just lines and text, I'd like to change them to various blocks with attributtes.Once we have the required blocks for the various object types, we need to finish mapping the other 33 Main Directories. With an unknown number of sub directories nested in each one, it's hard to know how much is left.I was looking for feedback on the progress and general interest in this project. I'm glad you are interested and willing to help. PM me and we can break down a few specfic tasks."

There are other commands that work as well, copy move and delete all work with the contents of the current directory.You can also do this from root, but you need the full path. The numbers for each directory can be used as the path from root ie. Assign Root 5.1.1.1 /xlra=off. This would turn off the DMX port A of the #1 console in the system."
