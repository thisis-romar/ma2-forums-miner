The result is the same.If you want the current selection in the programmer to take values from a selected fixture then marco is :1: Filter (x)2: At Fixture @Everything in the programmer will take the filtered values from the next number you type.If you want to specify a target fixture not currently in the programmer then add this line to the top:Fixture @This will leave values already in the programmer in place, and put the filtered values into the selected fixture.Thanks,Kurt"

This can also be used to extract certain attributes from presets as well.I tend to write a lot of \"All\" palettes and sometimes I just want the color, or position from that preset.I have a set of filters on the user 2 X11-X20 buttons under the  9\" display as part of my programming Marcos."
