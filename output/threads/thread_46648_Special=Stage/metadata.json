Didn't even notice this in the fixture menu.I was looking in the preset directories, I use the default and highlight special mode all the time, but didn't see the purpose for this mode, until now.I guess you could use this to create the 4 corners as position presets before you even start the calibration setup. Don't know if that is useful or not, it is an awesome tool, but I use it so rarely. The down side of doing one offs I guess.Thanks again Glad!"
