There fore I switch back to EnglishGlad to hear the Ignore Executor Time command is working but strange that the ratemaster command isn't working for youI'am using software version 3.1.0.8 (The latest release on a OnPC system) and all the commands you described are working here exept this one: [color=#FF0000]Assign Executor 1.1/Ratemaster=4.2[/color] Than the selected ratemaster has become the first digit you gave in (number 4 in this case)Have a good look in the use of spaces, sometimes this messes up macros"
