However, if I am creating a show via macros and want to avoid opening the effect editor and assigning high/low presets, is there a way?Thanks."

You can type this in your commandline. Use the commandline feedback to check what you do.First you have to go to the directory of your effect in the desk:cd effect 500Then, you want to see what is in your effect, and in which line the value is you want to edit.listSo now, you have your effect in your commandline screen. You can see all the values of your effect. All the stuff you see there, can be changed through commandline. You just have to figure out howThe line I first wrote is the one to change your low value. Go have funDon't forget to change your diractory to the desk withcd/"
