I've been looking everywhere for days now, but can't seem to find a solution.I would like to build a macro which stores, for example, gobo slots in presets. Now I can do that by setting attribute gobo1 to a value and store. Problem is that each fixture has it's gobo's at different values in the channel.What I'm looking for is to way to directly adress a slot from an attribute. For example gobo1 , slot 1, which open ofcourse. Than store that in a preset. Than slot 2 etc.I would like to achieve some sort of an autocreate, but it can be more manipulated.Does anyone has an idea?Much thanks!",
