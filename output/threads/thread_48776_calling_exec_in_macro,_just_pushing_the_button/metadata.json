Its mainly to organize your show and have a backup if you need an already deleted executor back. Of course you can playback directly out of this pool, but I think it is more complicated. I haven't did what you've request before. I hope there is an easy solution but actually I'm not sure."

So you can use the advantages of the normal playback control and additionally you can select an run as much cues you like together.I know that this is not exactly what you've requested but could be an easy solution.
