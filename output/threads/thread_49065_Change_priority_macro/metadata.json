Just fire the macro and the exec button for the given executor.CodeAssign exec (Which exec?) /priority=Xwill give you a popup where you can specify executor.I can not get this to work with effects though."

Because I have (& I imagine others have) only about 5 different combinations of Assign menu stuff that covers about 90% of the things I do. It would be handy to be able to make 5 macros that, well, you see where I'm going with this...Come to think of it, in a larger general sense, is there some kind of omnibus command line syntax reference that covers, well, pretty much anything and everything you can do via command line?Edit: and then I found this:https://app.teamsupport.com/wiki/justartic…ArticleID=28154"
