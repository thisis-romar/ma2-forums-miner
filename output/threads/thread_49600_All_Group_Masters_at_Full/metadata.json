Normally I'd address specific executors, but I have group masters that change location on a daily basis, as well as group masters that are created & deleted on a daily basis. So I'm basically looking for a command line version of holding down Group and pressing All Positive/Negative Full.",

I'll give it a shot, but I'm slightly hesitant to make this my final solution, just because I've got another programmer in parallel with me on this show, and I'm marginally freaked out about renaming all his groups. But maybe I can make it work if all my inhibs are within a specific group range, which I think is doable.Thanks"
