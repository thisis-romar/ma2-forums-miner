      "post_text": "November 17, 2017 at 1:32 PM#5Hello Bentoy,i'm gonna use it as a flashbutton to make an easy break in my live shows. when you are doing a hardstyle event with beats around 150 bpm it is one of the most effective ways to pick up a buildup or a break with a current running chaser.its like a flash button but instead breaking with strobes or dim effects i just flash the doublespeed;)a seq with 2 cue's: doublespeed and halfspeed. is  not 'fast' enough to reach, also, there is a big risk of messing up when restarting your chaser's or bumpers.thank you for the info!"
