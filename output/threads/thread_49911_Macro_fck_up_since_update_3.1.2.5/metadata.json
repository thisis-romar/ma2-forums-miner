It should create an effect with five steps.The first number is where it should be stored, and \"74 P10 Color Pulse\" is the one that starts the sequence.Before starting the macro, store a few fixtures at group 224 thru 228. The effect made will affect these groups.Files74 P10 Color Pulse _.xml7.4 kB – 106 Downloads49 RGB CTO + 72.xml862 Byte – 87 Downloads50 RGB CTO + 144.xml868 Byte – 107 Downloads51 RGB CTO + 216.xml868 Byte – 96 Downloads52 RGB CTO + 288.xml868 Byte – 101 Downloads"

We upgraded to 3.2.2.16 a good while back, but I only started having issues with my macro timing within the last couple of months. In some macros the wait times  I plug in work fine in seconds, but in other macros I have to multiply the value by 10 to get close to what I want...does anyone have a solution, or know if any of the more current updates address this issue?"

      "post_text": "August 21, 2018 at 3:26 PM#8UPDATE as of v3.3.4.3After much banging our heads on a brick wall, we finally figured out what our problem was. It is still not fixed for us so I don't know if there's a syntax problem on our end or if this is a setting we don't know or maybe it's just a bug. To recap here's the macro structure we have:Macro 1 Line 1 : Prompt for a passcodeMacro 1 Line 2 : If passcode is correct, run macro 2Macro 2 Line 1 : Group 1 At FullMacro 2 Line 2 : Park Group 1Macro 2 Line 3 : ClearAllEach line in Macro 2 had a 1 Second wait on it. What we realized was that the wait time for macro 2 line 1 started as soon as Macro 1 was fired. As a result, if the operator took more than 1 second to type in the prompt then Macro 2 Line 1's wait would be negated and Line 1 and 2 would fire simultaneously. We set the wait time for Macro 2 Line 1 to 10 seconds and were able to see that however long we took to enter the prompt in macro 1 was subtracted from the wait time in Macro 2 Line 1.A workaround or fix would be awesome, this problem tracks between computers and doesn't matter where the macro is in the pool for us.Thanks!"

      "post_text": "August 21, 2018 at 5:31 PM#9Wait times? Hm. Maybe there has been something changed the way that macros do not wait for things to complete. That's definately the case. Using operations that change things like groups or select worlds need a wait to complete the task. In general a few hundrets of seconds should be enough.In the case the user has to enter anything, the macro definately waits for the input. I do use this in 3.3.4.3 and it works.Codesetuservar $pass = (please enter passcode)[$pass == \"correct passcode\"] go macro 2This should prompt for an input and only if the input is closed with a \"please\" the macro will continue with line 2. In other case the macro will stop.To reduce coding you could also to a counting loop 'cause that's what you macro does.Codesetuservar $effect=16go macro 49...store ...adduservar $effect=1[$effect <= 24] go macro 1.1.2The last line calls the macro 1 again but starts at line 2, so the uservar $effect is not reset to 16 and the macro runs for another effect. In your specific case you will need more variables to increase all the values like phase etc. in the next loop.If you want to keep the macro it's easy to do a search&replace in the xml-file and then reimport the macro into the showfile. This makes replacing \"go macro 49\" by \"Attribute \"colorrgb*\" + \"cto\" At Effectphase 216\" a fast and easy job.Gralf"
