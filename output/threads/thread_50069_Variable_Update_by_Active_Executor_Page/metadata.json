Something like this, with the section with asterisks around it being the trouble spot:setvar $actfixpage = *Active Page*Not sure if this is even possible to work the way I want it to without running the macro each time I switch executor pages, but would definitely save a lot of time if there is a way to make this work.  Any suggestions?Jim",
