For example:I have a folder of 60 \"images\" that I want to create a sequence stack for with 60 cues, each cue will have 1 of the images just advanced by one each cue i.e.. Cue 1, clip 1... cue 60 clip 60.I believe the conditions I would need would be (how many cues?) and (What Clip?) Thru (What Clip?) and (What bank?) but I can't seem to think of the best way to auto record cues stepping up by one.Who knows, maybe this is impossible?Thanks for the help!",
