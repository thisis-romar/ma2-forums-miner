I come from theatre and on an ETC Ion there is a \"copy to\" function that is incredibly useful.Example: if I have a Mac Viper with a gobo, focus, colour and I want another viper with the same attributes I would just hit Fixture 1 \"copy to\" fixture 2.I tried fixture 2 at fixture 1 on the MA and it didn't work. Wondering what the syntax is for the macro.Q2: There is also a \"recall from\" button on the ION that lets me recall all the attributes of a light from any cue I specify.Ex: Say I have a red cyc in cue 1 and I want a red cyc in cue 5 I would just say \"fixture 1 recall cue 1\" then I would record that as cue 5. No idea what the syntax would be for that.Those are the two most useful things for when I do theatre programming and would love to junk the ion for my next tour and just go with my MA2 wing.Thanks All!Matthew ReickerLighting DirectorMr. Light Solutionshttp://www.mrlightsolutions.com",

The general syntax is \"Destination At Source\"Fixture (destination) At Fixture (source)Fixture (destination) At Cue (source)Group (destination) At Fixture (source)etc...If you press+hold [At] you'll get a filter allowing you to choose which attributes to copy.You might also look at \"Call\" ([On][On]). \"Call Cue x\" brings the contents of cue x into the programmer. Can be used in conjunction with If (e.g. \"Call Cue x If Fixture y\")."
