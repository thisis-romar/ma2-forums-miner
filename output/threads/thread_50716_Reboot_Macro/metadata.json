I have ~24 2 port nodes that require occasional rebooting and I don't want to have to look up the IP addresses every time. I was hoping to have a macro that contains a list of node numbers and associated IP addresses, so when I hit the macro it asks me what number node I want to reboot, then it reboots it. I just don't know the syntax for making the list and then accessing values in that list, if that makes any sense. (What I want to avoid is having an individual reboot macro for each node if possible)",
