There is no particular order to when these moments happen. I could jump from Sequence A to Sequence C at one point, and then have to jump from Sequence A to Sequence E later that afternoon. Not all Sequences have the same active values as others (i.e. Sequence A has a color put into some fixtures, but in Sequence B no color is active for those same fixtures). So currently jumping from one Sequence to another might cause some fixtures to remain in a color it shouldn't be, or position, etc..Is there a way to create nice transitions from one Sequence to another without having to manually crossfade?I'm trying to save space on my faders for other things and to simplify the task of going between sequences. I'm also trying to avoid selecting all my fixtures and activating all values for each cue (unless that truly is the best solution).Thank you.",
