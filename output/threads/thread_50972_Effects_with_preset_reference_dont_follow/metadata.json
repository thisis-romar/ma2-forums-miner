Is this a bug in the software?'The solution I have now is that I copy the color preset to the one i used in the effect twice, with a slight delay. It works, but makes the console do twice as much work. And because of the delay, the color change happens with a delay too.Maybe I'm forgetting something, a setting for the effect, or a function to reload the effects engine or something.Thanks!Harm Wellink",

My presets are all selective, and I'm having the same issue as mentioned above. But I tried it with a set of global presets and it seems to work okay. But what is the reason for this??Best, Jamie"
