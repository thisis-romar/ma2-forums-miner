TBH, probably not worth it, unless you're going to use it in the exact same scenario every time.You're looking at something like this: [color=#66FF00]Assign Root[/color] userprofiles.x.displays.y.z.1.3 /readout=natural (or decimal or percent or whatever)-  x is the name/number of your user profile-  y is the display which the sheet is on-  z is the line number of that sheet in the display directory"
