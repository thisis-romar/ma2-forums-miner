I have been fighting this issue with usually modifying the profile to the default gobo stop value and record a few sequences with slow, med and faster spin sequences. However never found a way to make a spin speed to be controlled by a speed master, Ideally I would like it to be controllled by effect and when I shut it down it gradually fades to default position.I have tryed before to limmit the dmx profile to have 0% as stop rotation and 100% as my full speed spin.Now adding to the complexity of the above... I am trying to prep my rig of B-Eyes, where the continueous spin is shared with index of the zoom rotation which gives coledo effect. So in this case I doo need to go past the spinning range to make my wide caledo look.So here is my ideas:1. Create (2) dmx profiles, one for spin and the other for indexing range, assign dmx profile spin to related dmx slots, then make a macro to replace dmx profile spin with indexing,***Someone please let me know how?2. Create one dmx profile, then via root assign new values to dmx profile everytime I want to swith in between profiles.Finnaly after switching to appropriatte (mode) program my cues with a thought in mind that I have to run the macro in every sequence which includes the related attributeLooking for comments, sugestions, your ways to do it",

      "post_text": "March 1, 2016 at 9:31 PM#2Can it be a separate fader that controls the gobo spin speed? Or do you need to use a Speed Master?If it can be a separate fader that only controls the speed for gobo spin, then it is quite simple.--Solution 1:Set your fixture profile's default value for gobo spin at a real world value of \"stop\" (the stop that is in between the two spins).Get the fixture doing the fastest rotate speed you would want and store it to an empty fader.Assign the fader as a Temp Fader.--Solution 2:Save a cue with the fixtures at a gobo rotate value of \"stop\". Make sure this cue is always on.Get the fixture doing the fastest rotate speed you would want and store it to an empty fader.Assign the fader as a Temp Fader.--Solution 3:Store a gobo preset with the fixtures at a gobo rotate value of \"stop\".Assign preset \"stop\" please, and select \"Default\".Double tap the preset once to enact the default then clear all.Get the fixture doing the fastest rotate speed you would want and store it to an empty fader.Assign the fader as a Temp Fader.--This fader will now control the speed of your gobo rotate from \"stop\" to the value you set. I don't think you could do it from one of the speed masters.The only difference between the solutions is in (1) you set the default value for the gobo rotate, (2) you save the stop state as cue and (3) you assign a preset default."
