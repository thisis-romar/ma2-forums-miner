What im trying to do is write a macro that asks which macro do i want to create and then asks which executor to reference and which cue. So far I have it as:Assign Macro 1.(Which Macro?).1 /cmd= \"Goto Executor 2.103 Cue ($Cue)\"Which doesnt work. I am ok (for now) with having to go back and change the executor number but i want to not have to go back each time and change the cue number or else i might as well just type out each macro anyways. Is there also a way to increase the UserVar integer by one? that way I can just say do this 10 times and then ask me again about wich executor to use.Thanks guysConnor",

      "post_text": "April 10, 2016 at 7:40 PM#3ok so I have a executor button, say executor 2.101, with 10 cues in it, each with a different color preset stored for all my lights. I want to now make an individual macro for each cue. So each macro would say \"Goto Executor 2.101 Cue x\" Now I have 8 Executors for various groups so i would need to make 80 macros. I dont feel like sitting here for a couple hours and typing out each macro.What Im asking is the syntax for a macro that would create all 80 of those macros. It stores the macro and then inputs \"Goto Executor 2.101 Cue x\" as the command, but I dont want 80 macros that call the same cue, so i was hoping to use a variable for the cue number that would increase by one everytime the macro ran through. And then I can use a condition so long as that variable doesn't go past ten it will keep running then ask me to change the executor number.Thanks,Connor"

      "post_text": "April 10, 2016 at 8:21 PM#4Okay, I get it.But 80 macros?! Creating them is one part of the job. Firering the other one. If you do not want to create (e.g. by copy-paste a default-macro and edit afterwords) such a bunch of macros, it will be much less fun to control them in a live-show.How about this? Think in a matrix:1. create 8 macros to select the group of fixtures to controlEach of these macros will set a variable with the executor inside to control.2. create 10 macros to select the cue (i.e. color) and fire the cue in the executor depending on the variable set before.This makes it much more handy and even faster to find the right macro.First group of macro:----------------------setuservar $ex = 2.101----------------------Second group of macro:----------------------Goto cue 1 Executor $ex----------------------To create those macros by another macro called \"wizard\" simply use this snippet:----------------------Setvar $loop = -1[$loop==-1] Setuservar $loop = 1setuservar $exno = 100adduservar $exno = $loopassign macro $loop /cmd= \"setuservar $ex = 2.$exno\"adduservar $loop = 1[$loop<=10] top macro \"wizard\"------------------------This code is created from scratch and not tested but the concept might be clear.Please have a try...Gralf"

I actaully wanted to make all my macros conditional to fade and no fade macro buttons that decide whether or not the macro calls a no fade cue or a cue with a predetermined fade time.I was going to try to just write a pair of macros that change the fade times for my cues rather than having two separate cues with different fade times, however i dont think i can use a variable to set fade times to be a variable fade between fixtures.... Have to keep experimenting..."

      "post_text": "April 10, 2016 at 9:07 PM#6On MA1 I had a similar problem and solved it like this:All Cues get a fade-time (e.g. 1sec) and the macro calls \"goto cue 1 fade 1\".To change the fading in speed just set the fader of the executor to rate with fader=rate=0  resulting in no fadetime. This works great.Maybe on MA2 you can combine the executors to a master-rate and assign this to one of the 100mm-fader.Perhaps macros could read the execfadetime and use it to control cuefading, but I don't have a specific code in mind for that.regardsGralf"

If all you have in these cues is color, I'd say that gralf's RateMaster suggestion is probably the way to go, unless you wanted to use Exec Time."
