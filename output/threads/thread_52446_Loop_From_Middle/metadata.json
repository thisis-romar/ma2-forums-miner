      "post_text": "April 13, 2016 at 5:07 PM#2Hi!Exactly! What is the question?If I want to jump to any other line inside a macro I just set a condition inside a user-variable and make conditional statements into the lines to be skipped, just like:--------------setvar $loop = -1[$loop==-1] fixture 1[$loop==-1] fixture 2fixture 3setuservar $loop = 3top macro 1--------------This works because the macro looks for a uservar with the given name. If none is specified the macro looks after a global variable with the given name. Thus resulting for the first run from line 1 in $loop as a global var with value == -1 in executing fixture 1 and fixture 2 (condition in bracket is true). After setting a uservar with the same name $loop and jumping to top of the macro the macro sees the value $loop == 3 and therefor skips the two lines fixture 1 and 2.A very ugly workaround but I don't see any better way until MA will offer some more commands like goto inside macros.Or any other ideas?RegardsGralf"
