Emergency-stop should be better done on hardware, not by showcontrol from the desk. What, if the desk crashes during movement? How to stop movement then? Think about that. Safety first!But to help you with your problem of a popup-message, try using a timer which holds the alarm-text and creates the popup. Have a look at this post:http://www.ma-share.net/forum/read.php…42889#msg-42889Creating popups on all desks for all users is dificult, 'cause most of the commands by links/macros are executed on the master-console.Gralf"
