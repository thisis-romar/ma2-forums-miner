If I type in \"Assign exec 14 /autostart=on\" that will turn on the auto start from the command line.  But I am trying to do it where line 1 lets you select the exec and line 2 changes the auto start or on or off.  trying to put @ in the command line isn't allowing me to do it either.  any thoughts?EDITFigured it out, incase anyone is wondering/autostart=on assign@then when you select that executor it will turn on auto start",
