Maybe I'm doing something wrong.setuservar $address = 1     --> results in $address = 1assign remote 3.1 /dmx=10.$address  ----> results in a null value in the dmx column of the remote line.My goal however, is to make the universe a uservar and the starting address of \"1\" a uservar that adds 1 in a loop to address 10 consecutive remote lines.So in a nutshell, I want the user to choose an empty universe in the show file and store it as a uservar..Then have a macro create 10 dmx remote lines using the user chosen universe.."
