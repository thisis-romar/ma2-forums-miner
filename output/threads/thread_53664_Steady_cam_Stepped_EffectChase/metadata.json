I would need to rebuild the sequence again.... boring... and slow if needed on the fly....Is there a way in which I can control a Single Shot effect with the same level of control?Any ideas are appreciated. I've got a week to perfect a solution.Dan.",

All gratefully received and tried.Unfortunately the lamps are doing the first half of the fade out before the maintained level is kicked in from the duplicated, and then one cue behind sequence. - so they all dip when firing the go command across all four sequences.Any ideas?Cheers."
