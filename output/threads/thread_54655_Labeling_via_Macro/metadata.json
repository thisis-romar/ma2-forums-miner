Here's what I'm wanting to do:Write a macro that will store a cue and then label that cue with a predefined name (i.e. Verse, Chorus, Bridge, etc).I've got macros that will store the cue, go to the cue, and then run the Label command. Then I have to type the name. I'm trying to eliminate typing the name itself, but if I put anything after the \"Label\" command, it tries to find a cue labeled that name.Anyone know how to do this? I'm just wanting several different macros that I can push \"Store Verse\" \"Store Chorus\" \"Store Bridge\" etc etc.Bonus points if I could have a single macro that I can push and then type in a number. 1=Verse 2=Chorus 3=Bridge, etc.-Tyler",

So if one of the 6 options isn't what you wanted the name to be, you can just type in the name and the macro will take care of it.Code01: Store02: Go03: SetUserVar $section = (\"1=Verse, 2=Chorus, 3=Bridge, 4=Inst, 5=Build, 6=Ending\")04: SetUserVar $otherBool = \"true\"05: [$section == 1]  SetUserVar $cuename = \"Verse\";  SetUserVar $otherBool = \"false\"06: [$section == 2]  SetUserVar $cuename = \"Chorus\";  SetUserVar $otherBool = \"false\"07: [$section == 3]  SetUserVar $cuename = \"Bridge\";  SetUserVar $otherBool = \"false\"08: [$section == 4]  SetUserVar $cuename = \"Instrumental\";  SetUserVar $otherBool = \"false\"09: [$section == 5]  SetUserVar $cuename = \"Build\";  SetUserVar $otherBool = \"false\"10: [$section == 6]  SetUserVar $cuename = \"Ending\";  SetUserVar $otherBool = \"false\"11: [$otherBool == true]  SetUserVar $cuename = $section12: Label Cue $selectedexeccue $\"cuename\"Display More"

As Ryan suggested there was a more efficient way of doing that, though.In practice, this macro hasn't been super useful. I don't use this macro to store cues and label them, as I've found it faster to just write 6 different macros for each. One push of a button gets me the result, instead of 3 (Macro, type number, please). If I used a lot of macros, I could probably consolidate it back, but right now I have room, so I just use a bunch for each situation."

Not at a console to test. fyi, I like to add the \"fade 0\" to this kind of macro so I don't have to wait for the cue to finish transitioning to name it. The macro gives me some trouble if I don't."

I.E. is there a string that is < 6 but not equal to 1-6? Like what happens if I typed 0 for some random reason.I'll have to do some reading on how MA compares variables, (more specifically strings)."
