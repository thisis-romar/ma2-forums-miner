The reasons for this are a little mind boggling and the function was originally programmed by someone else in the shows previous life - originally programmed on 3.1(I think) and I'm on 3.2.2.3.The macro is:-Off TimecodeFader 12 at 0%Fader 12 at 50%Go Timecode $currenttimecodeEverything runs as expected until the last line, what consistently happens is it will Go on the wrong timecode. For example, we are playing and have selected \"Timecode 2\" and when I run the macro in the command line I can see that it says \"Go Timecode 1\"; so it jumps back in to the wrong timecode and causes issues. It doesn't always jump back, if we're sitting in Timecode 3 it'll jump forward to timecode 4 and when we're in timecode 4 it doesn't jump. The same results happen when i run the commands manually in the cmd line.What is the variable $currenttimecodeactuallydoing and where is it getting its data from?ThanksRoss",
