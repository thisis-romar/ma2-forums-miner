(Also, maybe take a look atthis webinar(open link in new tab)).There are global variables and user variables. Set/Add/ListVar deal with global variables. Set/Add/ListUserVar deal with user variables. If you do SetUserVar, you won't see the resulting variable with ListVar, because you created a user variable, but are listing global variables."
