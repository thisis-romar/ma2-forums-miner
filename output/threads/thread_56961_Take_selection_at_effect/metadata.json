If you're on v3.1, you'd need to specify the entire range of lines getting looped, or break those into a separate macro that can loop from the last line to the first line."

A couple suggestions:- Don't really need $counter = $from - you can just use $from as the counter.- Might want to add /overwrite (/o) on the end of your Store line, so that you don't get a popup- Don't really need the conditional on the Store line. You're always going to want it to run the first time, right? After that, it will only get run again based on the second conditional anyway."
