I am working on automating my showfile and I am looking for a method to choose whether I want to overwrite or merge the programmer into existing sequences.I was trying to do it like this:1. setvar $option= (\"Overwrite or Merge?\")2. group x at preset y3. store /$option sequence zBut that doesn't seem to work...
