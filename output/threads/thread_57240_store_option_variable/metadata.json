I am working on automating my showfile and I am looking for a method to choose whether I want to overwrite or merge the programmer into existing sequences.I was trying to do it like this:1. setvar $option= (\"Overwrite or Merge?\")2. group x at preset y3. store /$option sequence zBut that doesn't seem to work... Any ideas?Thanks!",

When I get rid of de quotes and I input \"M\", the desk sees this as Macro.I now use it like this and it kind of works... I still get a popup asking me to overwrite or merge, but only once for all the sequences. Since I can't get store /$option to work, I use \"/m\" or \"/o\" as variable. Still trying to get rid of the popup though. But this is more an esthetical thing...SetVar $option= (\"Overwrite or Merge positions\")Store $option  Sequence x  Cue y  Fade 5"
