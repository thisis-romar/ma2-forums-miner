(I need the Macros for loading the images later on, thats why i didn´t assign the sequences directly)So I got different lines like \"spot\", \"wash\", \"led\" etc with 10 colors each.At the moment pressing the macro will lead to directly starting the assigned sequence.  (ofc)Now, is it possible to create like 2 extra \"buttons\" in my layout called \"Go\" and \"on\"??These two buttons should do the following:If \"on\" isNOTselected, color macros I press will not be fired till I press \"Go\" so basically colors are loaded till I press \"Go\" if \"on\" is not selected.On the other side of course I want my colors to  change directly if my \"on\" Button ist toggled on.Is something like this even possible, with the current way i try to program it ?I am kinda stuck on this one and can't get this to work like I want.Thank you in advance for your answersKind regardKevin",
