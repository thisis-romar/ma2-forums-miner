I tried it at my PC at home and my Macbook with parallels.Attached you have a screenshot after firering the macro. In this testshow i got 2 Executor and 2 position Presets (Exec. were made with this presets). I didnt lock anything on purpose. I can update them, if i correct the position of the fixture via hand.Thanks a lot for your help!FilesScreenshotCmdLine.zip220.9 kB – 717 Downloads"

And it looks like the replace did do something, based on the Command Line Feedback.How are you confirming whether or not this is working? For example, if you make a position preset that is \"0 Pan / 0 Tilt\", and then do the replace, you should see the Pan value adjusted."

      "post_text": "March 28, 2017 at 9:08 AM#8Thanks to both of you!ryan: It doesnt affect anything, just if i activate the preset, so that it appears in the programmer the macro works right. If I just select the fixture and fire the macro it doesn't work, except it apears in the command line, but the sequences and the preset don't change. Yeah my goal is if i press the macro every preset/scene changes at once, so i can preprogramm in 3D and then just have to adjust one preset in the vanue.glad: I tried both, selective and global.Maybe it is something in my global/local settings? I don't know any other way because it works on your show, but not on mine. Next i would try it on a fullistalled console. If this is not working either, I'm going to let it be ;D"

Stardet a show with the \"Cleanstart\" Desktop icon.Under 3.1.2.5 it works very well (both: with the world and with \"if Searchresult\"). Under 3.2.2.16 (exact same Macro, Cues and Presets) it snaps in its maximum position. E.G. Macro says:CodeReplace Attribute \"Pan\" At -270 Thru 270 With -265 Thru 275 if searchresultthe fixture goes into 225 as its maximum position.If I use:CodeReplace Attribute \"Pan\" At -270 Thru 270 With -265 Thru 270 if preset 2.1 thruIt says: 0 changesI'm close to give up and correct the position the traditional way....^^ It would be a nice macro but if it doesn't work for me...hm...I will try it with a Desk later this week and hope it's just my onPC/Mac with parallels who doens't work:/"
