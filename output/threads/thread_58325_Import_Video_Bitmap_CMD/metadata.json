Having this video in the show file has considerably lengthened the load time of my session/save across my network (2x Full Size, 1x NPU).I'm looking for a way to, via the command line (macro) to import the video file to the image pool for the particular song I need it for, and then delete it after so it doesn't have to live in my show file. Obviously I'm fine with the syntax of deleting the pool image, but I don't know the way to load it to the pool from the CMD line.I have the video file in the 'importexport' folder on my USB keyI have been trying: SD 4 import \"filename\" image 69 - but that hasn't worked. Please could someone shine a light and show me where I'm going wrong.Many thanks!! Jamie",
