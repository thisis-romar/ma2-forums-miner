I would like a way to replace all of the tilt values in these presets with the tilt value of a different preset (FOH Tilt Master). That way I only have to update a few different presets each day.I have tried: Copy Preset {{Tilt Master}} Attribute \"TILT\" at Preset {{x THRU x}} Attribute \"Tilt\"No luck.Also tried: Replace Preset {{ x THRU x}} Attribute \"TILT\" With Preset {{ Tilt Master}} Attribute \"TILT\"Only looking to replace the tilt values. Anybody know the proper syntax?Also if you have any suggestions for doing position presets in a different way I'd love to hear them. My basic idea is that I want a couple presets (FOH left, FOH Right, FOH Tilt) to populate more presets based on those values.",

To be clear, that only works in the All presets?I was originally envisioning something similar to when you make an Effect Absolute. Where if I edit Position Preset \"FOH Spread\" I can select the tilt information and when the calculator pops up I can then select a different Position Preset for it to get its value from.Thanks man!"
