The syntax you are using doesn't make sense for the console, you are now referencing a variable which might not even exist in your show, the syntax you wrote here can be used to hang an action after a certain value, in your case 1For example:Setuservar $interleave=(\"value 0 thru 255\")would ask for a value and set the newly created variable  to the choosen value[$interleave==2] MAtricksinterleave 2checks if the value of the variable $interleave is 1 and executes the assigned action; in this case it sets the MAtricks Interleave at 2As far as i know there is no command to check if the singleX is higher than 1, however you could reset the entire MAtricks engine with this command; \"MAtricksReset\" this will set everything to 0 and than you can start fresh"
