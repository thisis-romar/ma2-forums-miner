      "post_text": "August 2, 2017 at 4:14 PM#4hi, so i have one more question.once the effect has been assign to an exec, or execbutton, the macro line will not work for it.my example is this :i have made dimmer stacks for diff fixtures with dimmer cues for rig, floor etc. that will trigger macros, only selecting ifoutput fix in that cue and storing in the respective fixture dim fxs. the cd @ macro works very well with this since i ony have 6 diff fixtypes, and only need to open a small fx window for it, along with my execbuttons window.however, pos fx has pan/tilt/circ/fly, then with the cd @ macro i can assign forms/grps etc, but i need to open up the fx window, and lose out not having big execbutton window.my question is this.. is there a way to assign form etc on fxs assigned to execbuttons? like selfix, but for fx?or rather, in a more broad spectrum, how do i pull out fx from assigned fx execbuttons or even sequence and cues, and proceed to assign the variables?thank you for your time and knowledge!"

      "post_text": "October 20, 2017 at 3:39 PM#6This may be related to selective effects versus template effects.If you use a template effect to create playback data in an executor, the effect data becomes absolute (no reference to the original template). So if you use a macro to change the template, your executor doesn't contain a reference to the newly updated form in your template.If instead you use a selective effect, the executor references the effect pool each time the effect is called; so modifications by your macro to the effects pool will be reflected in playback."
