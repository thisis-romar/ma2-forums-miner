That is, on Executor one, for example, will trigger cue 2 while on Executor two, MIDI note 60 triggers cue 6.  I saw someone who had something similar and kept his showfile SO clean with such a minimal amount of MIDI notes and I'm looking to do the same thing but really stuck on how to even start writing that macro.Any help would be truly tremendous.Kai",
