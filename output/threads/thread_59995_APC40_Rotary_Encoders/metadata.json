I've got it about 90% functional, and I wanted to share my progress and possibly illicit some help if possible.Task: Map Encoder wheels to knobs of APC 40Using [url=http://www.ma-share.net/forum/read.php…30983#msg-30983]Pichi's Midicon macros[/url] I was able to get input to the encoder values.Then using some rules in bome I was able to get the knobs to react like continuous encoders (see code below)Codegd=pp-gaga=ppif gd==0 then Goto \"Check\"if gd>0 then Goto \"Up\"if gd<0 then Goto \"Down\"Label \"Check\"if pp==127 then Goto \"Up\"if pp==0 then Goto \"Down\"Label \"Up\"qq=65rr=12exit rules, execute Outgoing ActionLabel \"Down\"qq=63rr=11exit rules, execute Outgoing ActionDisplay MoreThe only issue I'm having now is that the align function resets to off as soon as I touch the encoder.Would anyone be able to shed some light on this?",
