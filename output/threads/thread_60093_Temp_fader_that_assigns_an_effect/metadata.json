I DONT want to fire the effect when i pull the fader up i just want to edit/assign the value. I also want to do it to more than one effect per fader, so I dont want to just assign the effect to a fader and then \"flip\" the fader.I have already made some cuelists so i can change for example the wings, and that works fine. I just use the command: assign effect 1.(the effect i want to edit) /wings=2. I have also done the same to the direction, blocks and groups. I my head i have to do something similar, just with a fader that fades from high value 0 to 25 and low value 0 to -25, but I cant figure out how i can fade between the values.If there is a better way to do it, please tell me.Thank you.",

I just want to \"edit\" the effect live without going into the effect generator.I use the command: Assign effect 1.32 /highvalue=25 ; assign effect 1.32 /lowvalue=-25 to \"edit\" the effect live, but i want to fade between 25 and 0 with the fader. So if i am at 50% on the fader, the value of the effect will be at 12.5 for the high values and -12.5 for the low values."
