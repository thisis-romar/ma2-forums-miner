I DONT want to fire the effect when i pull the fader up i just want to edit/assign the value. I also want to do it to more than one effect per fader, so I dont want to just assign the effect to a fader and then \"flip\" the fader.I have already made some cuelists so i can change for example the wings, and that works fine. I just use the command: assign effect 1.(the effect i want to edit) /wings=2. I have also done the same to the direction, blocks and groups. I my head i have to do something similar, just with a fader that fades from high value 0 to 25 and low value 0 to -25, but I cant figure out how i can fade between the values.If there is a better way to do it, please tell me.Thank you.",
