Basically creating a color swap \"bump\" that can be applied at anytime without programming hard values into a temp.I have found a way to do it, but the values stay active in the programmer.  Which is cool on it own, but I would like it to be more like a flash than a toggle.Here is a video of what the attached macro does.External Contentyoutu.beContent embedded from external sources will not be displayed without your consent.Display all external contentThrough the activation of external content, you agree that personal data may be transferred to third party platforms.

      "post_text": "February 20, 2018 at 7:14 PM#3Hello Kevin FriddellI think I have the solution. Here is roughly how I would do it:1. Create two empty presets2. Store the color of the first group in one preset (let's say 4.1) and the color of the second group in the other preset (let's say 4.2) using a macro.3. Create a Flat High effect, where the first group has preset 4.2 as high value and the second group has preset 4.1 as high value.4. assign this effect to a playback and make it a temp fader (or button).If you chose to do this, make sure you disable the option \"off on overwriten\" in the cue containing your stage look.I have included a showfile which demonstrates this. This way you can also exactly see how I achieved it.If this isn't what you want or have further questions, just let me know.Filescolor swap macro test.show.gz230.79 kB – 215 DownloadsBart HorneschLighting Designer,Lighting Technician,Lighting Operator."
