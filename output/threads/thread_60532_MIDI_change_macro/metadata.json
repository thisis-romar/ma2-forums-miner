Simple.Then, hypothetical Macro is run for Song 2, and MIDI notes 1-50 will now trigger cues 1-50 on Song 2. The same macro but for Song 3 is run and then MIDI notes 1-50 will trigger cues 1-50 of Song 3. I'm having trouble accessing MIDI settings in the command line which is halting me from being able to make this macro. Any advice?Thanks in advance!",
