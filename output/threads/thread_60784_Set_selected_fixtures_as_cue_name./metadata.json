In the first cue the selected fixtures go to 100% and on the second they go to 0% again.I can let the macro make a set label like “test”, but I want it to label the cues it just recorded according to the selected Group or fixtures. What would be the line I would have to type in the macro?I now have: label $selectedexeccue, but there needs to be a variable after that. What would that be?With kind regards,Kevin",
