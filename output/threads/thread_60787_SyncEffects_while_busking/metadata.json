This is what I use to sync all of my effects.If you need help creating this marco just let me know exactly what you want this macro to do.Bart HorneschLighting Designer,Lighting Technician,Lighting Operator."

Sometimes it doesn't work, though.Another way is to set up two executors with SpecialMasters for dimmer and P/T and assign your effect speeds to those. Then you can tap the learn button or play with your faders until they fall back in line."

So that when you fire the macro all the fx start over.setvar $fxexecutors = \"10.101 + 10.102 + 10.103\"          (Wherever they are for you)Off Executor $fxexecutorsOn Executor $fxexecutors"
