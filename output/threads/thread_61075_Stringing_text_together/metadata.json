Instead, string concatenation is done with Addvar.Setvar $fx_num = 1Setvar $fx_name = \"Red Blue \"  //Note the space between 'Blue' and the quotesAddvar $fx_name = $fx_num  //This is the concatenation stepCall Effect $\"fx_name\"  //Make sure you have the variable name in quotes so that the contents are treated as a stringAddvar $fx_num = 1[testing for loopage] loop back to line 2...or something along those lines"
