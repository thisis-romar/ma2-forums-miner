I tried several command line syntax entries but could not find one that worked?For example a cue stack has cues 1,2 and 5 stored. If I am in cue 2 the macro would store cue 3.Also looking to make a macro that stores the next .1 cue from my current cue.for example if I am in cue 2.2 it would store cue 2.3.Any help would be appreciated.Thanks.",
