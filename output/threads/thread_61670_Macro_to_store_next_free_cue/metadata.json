I tried several command line syntax entries but could not find one that worked?For example a cue stack has cues 1,2 and 5 stored. If I am in cue 2 the macro would store cue 3.Also looking to make a macro that stores the next .1 cue from my current cue.for example if I am in cue 2.2 it would store cue 2.3.Any help would be appreciated.Thanks.",

I noticed with the .1 macro it only runs after it has been applied twice? like it is not advancing to the next free cue but stores to the previously created cue the first time it runs, and then the next cue if you run it again, any thoughts?Thanks for your help.Cheers, Michael"
