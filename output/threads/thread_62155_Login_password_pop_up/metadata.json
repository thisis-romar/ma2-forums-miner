I’m trying to make a startup macro that brings up a pop up that asks you to type in a password. If you type in the wrong password I want it to go back to the pop up and not let you into the showfile.

No need for a macro.It's in the global settings.To force a login by command/macro use the command \"login please\" without any user. This will popup the login-screen, too.Gralf"
