The commands you sent me I was able to execute only the first part, when it locks all the macros and puts the password, but when I go to run the second part to enter the password to release the macro was not successful.Maybe I messed up the Macro assembly .... But anyway it's still not what I imagine, but thanks for your help!"

There is no way to absolutely lock or hide any content. Anybody can login als administrator and have access to anything. Locking objects like macros only prevents from deleting or changing the object until it's unlocked.Maybe there might a way with a LUA-plugin to scan the commandline for the command \"edit macro\" and then immediately close the macro editor when it was opened. But I don't think so.There are some tricks to use like disabling the CLI for the macro. This would prevent the command edit with pressing the macro inside the pool. But this only blocks basic users, no advanced users.Please report here if you have found any solution. This is interesting to me, too.Gralf"

You have to dive into some really advanced LUA-writing to achieve this.As Martin said, I have a destroy-show plugin too. After running the show on a rented desk, I simply run this plugin and since my file naming always is [FD] 2019 - [venue] - [show], I simply destroy everything that begins with \"[FD]\".Kind regards,Floris DijkersLighting Director & Designerflorisdijkers.comlighting@florisdijkers.com"
