I had the same problem yesterday.Maybe the macro could be added another line likeCodepresettype $PRESETTo switch off the DMX-tester-labeling on the encoders like it is shown when used with onPC. Don't know, how this looks on console when leaving desklock.Gralf"

This might confuse some users.2. Login on first line, then the dmx-hardkey-remote-thing.> result: the console enters the login-screen and then locks in the back.If the user logs in the console is still locked and seams to be frozen, but it's not. It's just locked. Just unlock once with pause.This just has been tested with onPC 3.5.0.2 on Win10 and on console. Very cool, but I guess it's only working on Session-Master.Gralf"

I just did a dummy dimmer and used it through DMX remote to press hard key MA,  then same thing for Fix... It does not work on console, am I missing something?"
