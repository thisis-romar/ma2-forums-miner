I have it down but it requires me to divide twice, in the correct order of operations.Here's the Macro:PresetType \"Color\"Attribute \"ColorTemperature\" At (Color Temperature) - 2800 / 0.10986496 / 655.35Mathematically this works to get the correct percentage, however the command line is processing the equation as a whole. It needs to subtract 2800, divide that answer by .10986496, then divide that answer by 655.35 (For 16-bit).Is there a way instead to set the attribute to the dmx value wherever it lands in 0-65535 in the macro so I don't need to divide by 655.35 to get the percentage?",
