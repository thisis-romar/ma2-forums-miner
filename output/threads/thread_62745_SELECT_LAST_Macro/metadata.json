It's for those times I clear a selection or clear all, but want to re-select the previously cleared fixture/group/channel (but NOT the attributes I had in the programmer). It's like Oops but only for selection. So if I reconsider a color or gobo choice, I don't have to think \"oh which group was this?\" or have to search for the right fixture, I can just fire this macro and change what I want. And preferably, like Oops, it goes back a little in ways in command history. A little knitpicky I know.If anyone has any insight into this, I'd appreciate it, thanks!-Chris",
