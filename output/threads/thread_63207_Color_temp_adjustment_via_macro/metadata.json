My question is, how can make it so that it only applies to my selection? If I have nothing selected and hit it, everything with that attribute goes to the color temp that I enter, but adding the word Selection at the begining doesn’t do it. Any help is much appreciated.As it is now:Attribute”colortemperature” At (Temp?)",
