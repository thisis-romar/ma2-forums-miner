      "post_text": "February 16, 2019 at 12:55 PM#3Hi William,thanks for the bugreport.Seems that I had managed to insert an illegal character into that line, in the late tidying.The tricky thing about illegal characters in MA is that they are not all properly filtered out(depending on local language and keycodes)on my Norwegian keyboard $ is AltGr-4, and £ is AltGr-3if I accidentally hit 3 instead of 4, the £ character is inserted, but invisible with zero width.and it is easy to just think that you didn't hit the AltGr-4 properly, and you enter the dollarsign, resulting in £$myvar, but displayed as[color=#000033]£[/color]$myvar(highlight text do see)This can only be seen in the xml, but can be detected on the console, by using the arrow key, where you suddenly will see that there is an extra arrow-press necessary to move past that invisible character.nevertheless, I have uploaded the edited version."
