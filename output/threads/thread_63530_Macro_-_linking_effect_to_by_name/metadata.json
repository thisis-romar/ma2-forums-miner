I can make the macro work just fine with a simple reference to the effect in question:Example:assign effect 1.67 /wings= 0Yet I'm attempting to make a series of effects with the same naming convention that can be affected by the same macro.Example:Assign effect 1.*\"stage\"*.1 /wings= 0The idea is to create a series of effects such as stage(wash) stage(wash2) stage(left) etc.... but have one series of macros affect those groups.When I do this I keep getting:error 14 \" Object does not exist\"Am I missing something?",

If the effect is in the programmer then it remains running.vsAssign effect \"*stage*\".1/ wings = 0It stops the effect and changes the wings value. The effect has to be triggered again to continue. Somehow this command trigger creates a \"stomp\" like affect on the effect.Any thoughts?"

I don't have the console in front of me, but I THINK it should read like:assign effect 1.\"stage\"*.x /wings=0remember that in the macro, for symmetrical effects, you'll want to add a different line that changes pan values to -2, -4, etc.I have something similar in my punt file for my various effects, but not for changing parameters, I use it for updating the fixture counts of my effects."
