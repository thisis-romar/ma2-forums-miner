When you go to create the effect, make sure the Low and High values are the min and max physical values of your fixtures Pan/Tilt. Example:Your movers can pan 540deg and tilt 270deg. Your Pan Effect Low value should be -270 and High value 270. Tilt Low value -135 and High value 135.You can choose between a linear fade or spline between points, which allows you to create some fun forms, like circles, ovals, squares, triangles, figure 8's...etc.FilesPosition Form Generator.xml9.31 kB – 181 Downloads"
