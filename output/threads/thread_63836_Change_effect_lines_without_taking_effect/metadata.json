I'm trying to change various bits of an effect line via macro, with this syntax:Syntax: Assign Effect $FXCurrentTemplate /groups = $GroupsFXLess Variables: Assign Effect 397 thru 417 /groups = 1Now, that does change the groups like it should, but it also starts the effects with any fixtures selected, which I don't want. The issue is that I'm wanting the macro to change a handful of template effects, but in practice I am likely running ONE of those effects and using this macro to change the line, which also starts the other effects.I just need a way to not start the effect(s) when I change a line within those effects. Feels like I'm missing something dumb... Any thoughts? Thanks in advance!",
