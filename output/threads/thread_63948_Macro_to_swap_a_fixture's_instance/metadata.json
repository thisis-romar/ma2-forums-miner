      "post_text": "May 17, 2019 at 12:42 PM#5If you are familiar with the fixture, it will be easier to understand..But mainly because if for example you arrive at a venue, and you find out that the IVLs were hanged in a certain orientation, meaning that in the original design the screen panel of the fixture (meaning, TILT 1 or .2) should face down, and physically it is facing left for example, then some cues, especially in terms of position and symmetry, are all messed up.A macro to determine that, should theoretically solve this issue..It is something in the likes of pan/tilt invert in a standard moving head fixture, but I guess a step further for an instance invert.."

      "post_text": "May 20, 2019 at 5:36 AM#6so normally when a fixture is hung the opposite direction from how it was programmed using previs, you can swap the fixture profile from the desk. christian jackson has avideoexplaining it, but essentially you just reverse the addresses for the fixtures instances.this situation may be a bit different, however, in that you have multiple tilt instances (odd), but in theory it should still work if you just swap the addresses for the tilt attributes to correspond to how they are hung in real life. alternatively, most fixtures will have a menu option to reverse pixel/tilt when this is possible (x4 20 bar, chorus line 16, colorforces)"
