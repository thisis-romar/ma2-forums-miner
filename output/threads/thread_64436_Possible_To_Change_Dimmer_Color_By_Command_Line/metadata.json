The value to set the color to red would be just 255, but for cyan it is 16776960. Every time you get over 256, the next color will add 1 value and red begins again with the next 256 steps.The syntax for cyan would look likeCodeAssign root livesetup.layers.3.1.1 /color=16776960A few examples:red=255green=65280yellow=65535blue=16711680cyan=16776960Visit my website to get nice 3D fixture profiles for grandMA2 and dot2NRGSille Lighting Design"
