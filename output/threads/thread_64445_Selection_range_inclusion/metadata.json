I don't want that....pfffft, and don't get it.  Why all the *.1's as well, I thought I specified from only starting .2 onward?!?I had used this some time ago and it works to only select the Main instances:[color=#00FF33]Fixture *.1[/color]and this works perfectly; no matter how many fixtures are patched, only the main instances are selected.  What have I done wrong to include the *.1 instances as well in my calling?  At least in the GUI the .1 instances are yellow and seem selected and I have to deselect them get them to grey out.Thanks!",
