So I added one \"OddSpot\" group to another \"EvvSpot\", \"LeftSpot\", \"RightSpot\" and so on, only one fixrure for each different group, so at the time of cloning I just clone the Fixture I added in each group.This is the command line:Clone Fixrture \"LeftSpotSource\"  At Group \"LeftSpot\"  If Sequence 1  Thru /lm /nc"
