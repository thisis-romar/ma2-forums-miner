I writed my macros to clone all my presets and stuff to the PSR-imported groups. But to make sure my effects will take the new groups (I just cloned my information to), I will have to do the following:- Open the effects I want to update (for example spot dim saw).- Select my PSR-imported group with the cloned information- Click \"take selection\" in the effect editor- Clear twiceIs there a way to do this by a macro? But like, for al my main groups apart. So spots, beams, wash, LED1, LED2, Strobes and blinders.I will have to make a macro for all those groups apart, but I just aren't experienced enough in advanced macro-writing to know exactly what syntax I need here.If you have any questions please reply, I'd love to solve this and fasten my cloning-process.Kind regards,Floris DijkersLighting Director & Designerflorisdijkers.comlighting@florisdijkers.com",
