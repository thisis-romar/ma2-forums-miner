If the password is correct the file opens, if it is incorrect it asks again for the password and if the user presses the [X] button it loads a new blank showfile. I know it can be done as i came across it on festival LD's showfile but obviously couldn't open the file to view the macro.Cheers.",

I suppose this macro loaded in the StartUp should do the job:>>> SetUserVar $inequal = \"yes\">>> SetUserVar $pass = (\"Enter the password, please\")>>> [$pass == \"truselya\"]  SetUserVar $inequal = \"no\">>> [$inequal == \"yes\"]  NewShow \"new\" /nc>>> SetUserVar $inequal = \"\">>> SetUserVar $pass = \"\"\"truselya\" is the correct password.If you want to ask the user one more time you should modify this code a liitle bit.P.S. A long ago I understood the idea is bad. Don't use it :))"
