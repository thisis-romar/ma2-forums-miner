There is likely an easier way to do what I'm looking to do but just seeing if this is possible.For example:CodeSetVar $FROMOBJECT = \"Macro 999\"SetVar $TOOBJECT = @Apperance $TOOBJECT At $FROMOBJECTObviously storing $TOOBJECT like this wont work since i need to store a string (\"\"). I could do this with a (From?) and enter a number but I was just playing around and wounding if just pressing the object is a viable option.Thanks.",
