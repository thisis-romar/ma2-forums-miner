I was wondering if there was macro I could create to make an agenda for the next morning?In the morning we have to have some Midinotes trigger to bring down a projector screen and route the AMX patching. There is a macro for doing all of this and I have to make an agenda manually for when I want it to be fired. Annoyingly the days always change when it is needed so I can't go through and add them all. So it would be handy if I could create a macro to do it then I can just press it the night before.Cheers,Jazz",
