I want to build a macro which stores a selective preset as universal preset. What I was looking for, was the possibility to call the Macro, tab the Preset and then restore a Preset with that particular preset ID.Therefore I want to extract the ID and store into a variable.Am I wrong to do so? Is it even possible?Thanks",
