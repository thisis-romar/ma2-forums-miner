Ma will then search the variable inside the quotes.Also we have to put '/cmd = ' infront of our String.Least but not last we have to create an empty macro, such as an empty macro line, so we may edit it.now working:SetVar $tmp=\"faderpage \"AddVar $tmp=(\"input\")store macro 3store macro 1.3.1Store Macro 1.3.1 /cmd = $\"tmp\""
