Macro would look like this:CodeDelete Sequence Thru - Sequence Thru If Executor ThruI'm not sure what you mean by order them at number 1? The pool items are always in order?Kind regards,Floris DijkersLighting Director & Designerflorisdijkers.comlighting@florisdijkers.com"

I use this little trick, I wrote it down already before in some document:Macro line 1:CodeOff Sequence ThruMacro line 2:CodeGo Exec ThruMacro line 3:CodeDelete Sequence Thru - IfActive Sequence ThruHopefully this helps you!Kind regards,Floris DijkersLighting Director & Designerflorisdijkers.comlighting@florisdijkers.com"
