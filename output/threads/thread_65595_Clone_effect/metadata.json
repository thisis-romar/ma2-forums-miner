      "post_text": "April 24, 2020 at 6:34 PM#5I would avoid using 'merge' in this case.most people use 'overwrite' for storing a new effect selection, since normally you're going to take your new selection and store it as the new selection, rather than just adding two more fixture onto the end of it.I also hate these shortcuts.if you are trying to copy an effect line with a new selection to a new effect line, you cancopy effect 1.effect.line at 1.effect.linethen take selection andstore effect 1.effect.line /oif you are trying to just clone two fixture to two other fixtures already in the effect, use clone.clone fixture x at fixture y if effect z"
