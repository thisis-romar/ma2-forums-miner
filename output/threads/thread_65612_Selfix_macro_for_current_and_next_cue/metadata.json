Basically what I want is to ask me Current or Next and then selfix according to the selection (obviously).Only way I thought for selecting the next cue without changing the ouput on stage is through preview modeSo far it goes like this and is working (All Follow) :ClearSelectionPreview Edit OnSetVar $answer=(\"Which cue do you want to SelFix ? 1=Current / 2=Next\")[$answer==\"1\"]  SelFix Cue[$answer==\"2\"]  Preview Next ;  SelFix PreviewExecutor CueAny suggestions to improve this macro ? What do you think ?",
