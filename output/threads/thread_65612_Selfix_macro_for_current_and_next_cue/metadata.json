Basically what I want is to ask me Current or Next and then selfix according to the selection (obviously).Only way I thought for selecting the next cue without changing the ouput on stage is through preview modeSo far it goes like this and is working (All Follow) :ClearSelectionPreview Edit OnSetVar $answer=(\"Which cue do you want to SelFix ? 1=Current / 2=Next\")[$answer==\"1\"]  SelFix Cue[$answer==\"2\"]  Preview Next ;  SelFix PreviewExecutor CueAny suggestions to improve this macro ? What do you think ?",

      "post_text": "May 1, 2020 at 5:38 PM#3Thanks, I like this approach as well.Im just looking for different thoughts about quick access. All I'm trying to do is to save steps while programming or updating a cue. It is not for a specific task, no worries.I tried your macro (I found out I had to add «Cue» after Selfix, otherwise it would not selfix anything)  and it works well !Only problem, if my cue number is not whole (.5, etc) and I try to select the next cue, I would get error message like this (example, with actual Cue 2.5) : Error : Selfix 3.50000000000 Erro #9 : Number too large (Cue 3,5 doesnt exist)That is probably because $nextexeccue adds 1 to the actual cue number value to select the next one. I will try to find a different way, otherwise changing the cue numbers from the cue list should correct this issue as well.Thanks a lot !"
