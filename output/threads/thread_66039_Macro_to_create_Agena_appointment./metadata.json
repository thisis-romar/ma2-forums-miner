Manually create a new Agenda item with all necessary settings to switch your \"Backline work\" on, using an expired date/time2. Manually create a new Agenda item with all necessary settings to switch your \"Backline work\" off, using an expired date/time3. type \"List Agenda thru\" and notice the index of your last two entries you just made.e.g assuming you originally had 10 entries in the agenda, and the two new on/off agendas was created as index 11 and index 12, create a macro to be operated, that goes something like this:Code#create a copy of your known agenda itemsCD AgendaCopy 11 + 12PasteCD Root#get input from the user in proper formatSetvar $AgendaDate= (\"Date? e.g 12/31/2020\")Setvar $AgendaTimeOn= (\"Start? e.g. 20h30m)Setvar $AgendaTimeOff= (\"End? e.g. 22h0m\")#adjust the settings of the known agenda itemsAssign Agenda 11 /First=$\"AgendaDate\" /Time=$\"AgendaTimeOn\"Assign Agenda 12 /First=$\"AgendaDate\" /Time=$\"AgendaTimeOff\"Display More"
