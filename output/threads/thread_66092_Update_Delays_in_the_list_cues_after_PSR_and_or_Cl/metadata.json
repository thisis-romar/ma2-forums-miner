Due to the cloning proces the newly cloned fixtures information will take the exact same information as the source fixtures and the corresponding presets will take this info as well, so you need to update the presets at first and than run your macro."

      "post_text": "September 24, 2020 at 8:36 PM#4well, it depends how you have things set up.If, for example, you have 8 fixtures and your preset is those 8 fixtures with a delay of 0 thru 1, cloning that same thing to 16 fixtures, for example, would do the following:fixture 1,2:      delay 0fixture 3,4:      delay .125sfixture 5,6:      delay .25sfixture 6,7:      delay .375sfixture 7,8:      delay .5sfixture 9,10:    delay .625sfixture 11,12:  delay .75sfixture 13,14:  delay .875sfixture 15,16:  delay 1swhich is not really what you want. You want:fixture 1: delay 0sfixture 2: delay .065sfixture 3: delay .125sfixture 4: delay .1875s, and so on.But these delay values don't exist in your preset since you only started with 8 fixtures.there are several ways to solve this while cloning.The way I do it is to write a macro that actually creates the preset before storing it to the places you need it to store to.In this case, select your fixtures, use the correct syntax for the attribute you are trying to use- something like \"attribute 'dim' at delay 0 thru 1,\" then store the preset, then store your cue.I can't remember if this is the correct syntax but something of this nature."
