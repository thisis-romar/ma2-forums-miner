      "post_text": "September 28, 2020 at 5:29 PM#2If I'm understanding this correctly, in your first macro insert a new command at line 4:Assign Macro 1.\"Clone Beams All\".15 /Disabled=YesThen in your second macro put a new line 16:Assign Macro 1.\"Clone Beams All\".15 /Disabled=NoSo if your first macro is called, it won't execute line 15 in your second macro, but will enable it after being executed in case you call it by itself.Just be careful because if you insert any new macro lines in your second macro, then the line you want to disable no longer becomes #15.Another way to do this is with a variable following the same steps above.First Macro New Line 4: Setvar $Condition = \"True\"Second Macro Line 15: [$Condition = \"False\"](Clone Beams All OK! Aperte Enter)Second Macro Line 16: Setvar $Condition =\"False\""
