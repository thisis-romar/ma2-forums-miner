I'd added \"Mode = Additive\" to the end but the interpreter was changing \"Mode\" to \"Model\" ([Oops] to the rescue).  Also tried \"/m=additive\", \"/m=3\", \"/mode=3\", etc.  Your help is awesome!By the way, is this in the manual and if so can you point me to it?  I searched for \"mode\" and \"additive\", read the \"Group masters\" section and went through the \"Command Syntax and Keywords\" but never saw it or missed it. <shrug> In \"Executor Keyword\" (in \"Command Syntax and Keywords\") I see \"Assign Executor [ID] /[Parameter] = [Parameter Value]\" but \"Mode\" isn't listed.At any rate, thanks again on behalf of me, my head, and the wall I was banging it against!"
