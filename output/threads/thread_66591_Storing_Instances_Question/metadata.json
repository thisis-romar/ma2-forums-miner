Start by selecting the fixture as a whole, and click the MAtricks as desired:MAtricks 1: Interleave 21, Single X 1 (selects just the main module - master dim, tilt, zoom, beam, etc)MAtricks 2: Interleave 21, Single X 2, Blocks 20 (selects the individual pixels)you don't need to click the Reset MAtricks button to restore the original selection, it's still there for you. The selecting and storing can easily be done via macro. I have LOTS of MAtricks' saved in my show, and export/import as needed.Hope this helps!"
