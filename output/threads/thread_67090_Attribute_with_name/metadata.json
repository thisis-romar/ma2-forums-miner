Of course i know there is AutoCreate but i dont want to create for example 63 different Shutter \"position\" i will never use. My idee is to write a macro which I can just select a fixture and then say (Fixture X Attribute \"BEAM\" at \"max Strobe\"). Instead of go and look which is the right Value for the \"max Strobe\" i want to us the name. Is that possible and when yes how i have to write the macro?Thx for our Help!tweb463",

Provided the presets in question are global, you can either A: update your presets as normal, then store one extra fixture with no patch into a layer in your patch specifically for \"Fixturetype Storage.\" That way the global presets are maintained through the fixture type even after deleting them from your active fixture layer (i.e. when cloning a rig day to day). Option B: start looking at Preset References (Setup > Auto Create > \"Create Preset Reference\" Tab), which will store the presets you've made as a part of the fixture type. CheckHEREfor a quick video on it.Hope this helps!"
