Of course i know there is AutoCreate but i dont want to create for example 63 different Shutter \"position\" i will never use. My idee is to write a macro which I can just select a fixture and then say (Fixture X Attribute \"BEAM\" at \"max Strobe\"). Instead of go and look which is the right Value for the \"max Strobe\" i want to us the name. Is that possible and when yes how i have to write the macro?Thx for our Help!tweb463",
