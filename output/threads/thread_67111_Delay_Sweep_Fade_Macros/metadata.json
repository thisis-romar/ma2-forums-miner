So my cues are 99.1 cue 1 so on and so forth.I want to create macros to delay and sweep color when I click on the color picker.For example, I want a macro to delay 0.5s for each type of fixtures but on just one button. Same thing with sweep and fade but I think the mechanic would be the same as the first one.If you have ideas, that would help me, Thank you.",

But if I were going to do it was a macro, I would do something like this:CodeBlindEdit OnIfOutput At PageName.SequenceNameMATricksWings 2PresetType \"COLOR\" at Delay 0 Thru 0.5Store Cue 1 Thru SequenceName /mergeClearAllBlindEdit OffAlternatively, you could select a group or whatever lights you wanted in the third line. Then I would create multiple macros that would simply merge the fade / delay times and wing styles that you wanted. You could also have the macro ask you for a value for a variable so it would ask what you wanted the fade time to be every time you called it.Craig RutherfordBlueshift Design"
