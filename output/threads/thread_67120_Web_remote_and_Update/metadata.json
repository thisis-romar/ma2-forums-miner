Those band specials are all in my 'BAND' position preset, and the lights I use don't change from show to show, so I have a sequence where there's a cue with a command to select the fixture and put it at its intended position, I move it as I see fit, then go that same sequence. The next cue has a command for store merge. next one is clearall, then repeat. tedious to set up, but it does work well. I use a similar method for updating all of my presets in fact, so its one GIGANTIC sequence to pull up each group (fixturetype in my case), and go through each preset in my show, with store merge cues to simulate a live update experience.Hope this helps!"
