For example,  action button one will contain 5 sequences (my 5 colors) for that one fixture. The action button below, will contain another 5 sequences with (5 Gobos). Why is that when I run the color off one of my sequences and then press one of my gobos, the color automatically resets to white? Does Priority have to be changed? I am looking to then add DIM & Movement FX but all reset.",
