Here is what I am trying to accomplish:I am doing a lot of work with Ayrton Magic Panel 602's which have individual pixel control (each LED is an individual sub fixture).  In order to speed up programming of specific patterns, I am using the following macro:SetUserVar $myFixId=(Fixture #?)Fixture $myFixId.2Fixture $myFixId.5Fixture $myFixId.8And so on to select the specific LED pixels I want to form the pattern.  I write one of these macros for each shape I am trying to accomplish to save for future use.The problem with this macro is that you can only select one Fixture at a time (very time consuming when you are trying to apply the macro to 25+ fixtures over and over).  What I am trying to do is either modify this macro to allow for multiple fixture selection, or write a separate macro that allows me to apply this macro to multiple fixtures at once.  Any ideas on how to best accomplish this?  Thank youJim",
