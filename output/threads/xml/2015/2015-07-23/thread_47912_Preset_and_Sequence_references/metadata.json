This time some of the lighting equipment have changed, although the cloning part of it have worked out without any certain issues.What I am looking into now is all the Position Presets. I would like to tidy my palettes up a bit and was wondering if there is a way to see if a Position Preset is used in my particular \"Show\" Sequence? If not I would like to delete them.Another question regarding the sequence referencing, is there a way to figure out if some fixtures in a certain Position Preset are not used/referenced in my \"Show\" Sequence and therefore can be taken out of that particular Preset?Best regards,Michael",
