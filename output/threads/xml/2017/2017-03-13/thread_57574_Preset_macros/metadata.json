So far I have been making them using the hard values for each attribute... Which works well and easy to make for the fixtures I have already used in shows over the past few years because I can lod my old show file and just look at the presets I already have those fixtures... But I am wondering if there is a way make a macro that accesses the \"Min Strobe\" \"Max Strobe\" \"Min Rdm\" etc. that you see when you press the encoders...I've tried something like this: Attribute shutter at \"Min Strobe\"  and a few other approaches...Is it possible to do it this way?Also, I am using macros instead of using the \"Create Preset Reference\"Because I find it easier to import a macro for that fixture type and have it use the names I already use instead of having it import new ones... Am I crazy or am I just not understanding how \"Create Preset Refernce\" works?Attached is a copy of my macro for the Clay Paky sharpy for reference.Thanks for any help you can give.Filessharpy presets.xml7.56 kB \u2013 82 Downloads",
