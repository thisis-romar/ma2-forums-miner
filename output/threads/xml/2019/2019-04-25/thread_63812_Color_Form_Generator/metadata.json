Write down the RGB values (in percent) of the colors you want to add to the form. Run the macro and answer the questions. You can also choose if you want the form to crossfade or snap/chase between the colors as well.Let me know of any issues, or if you're interested in adding more colors or a similar macro using other attributes like Pan/Tilt.Enjoy!FilesColor Form Gen.xml16.75 kB \u2013 153 Downloads",
