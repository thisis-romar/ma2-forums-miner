Yes, I have been around that long...Basically, this macro selects a different drive every 15mins and saves the show file.I know what you're thinking, \"but the console has an auto save function, why would I need something like this?\"Well, the answer is simple, if you carry around a few drives, like a lot of us do, this macro will save everything you've done for the last 15mins on a different drive, so if you have a major issue, or simply want to back to something you accidentally deleted, now you can.Extremely basic syntax, so you can add as many drives as you want.(side note, the first USB is usually drive 4... and the numbers work there way from left to right on the backup screen with \"internal\" being drive 1.)Let me know what you think and if you find this useful,  Happy programming!FilesLEAP FROG SAVE.xml984 Byte \u2013 84 Downloads",
