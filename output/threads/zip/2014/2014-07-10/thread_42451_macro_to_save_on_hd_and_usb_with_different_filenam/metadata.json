Bouth macros will create new files on each press!To save the changes without making a new file just press backup twice and it will save on the last file ( but on the console only! )If you forgot what is the name that you entered last time, just time ListVar and on the last line will be the $name variable contentFilessaveTime.zip1.83 kB \u2013 746 Downloads",
